Yes, but then you would have had two "keys" in the keyservers and on
people's keyrings.

Correct.  If they do not specify a particular key to encrypt to, GnuPG
will make a reasonable guess for which subkey to use (it uses the one
with the most recent signature, which generally means the most
recently created key).

Generally this is not an issue since people usually don't have very
many active encrypting subkeys at the same time.  Usually there is
only one, and a new one is added some time before the first expires.
Once the new one is widely distributed the old one is revoked or
allowed to expire.

If you are intend to use different keys for home and work, that
particular case sounds like it would be more convenient to use two
different full keys.

Mostly correct.  GnuPG is biased internally towards subkeys.  If you
don't specify otherwise, it will use a subkey over the master key if
possible.  To specify a particular key, you can use --local-user and
append an exclamation mark to the key id.  This means "Don't try and
figure out which subkey to use.  Give me this exact key id."

All correct.  It would be sort of interesting to be able to have
different passphrases for different subkeys, and there is nothing in
the standard that prevents it, but GnuPG doesn't do it now.

Message-ID: <20020301000236.GG691@akamai.com>

Hi folks,

What with all the discussions of multiple subkeys, I wanted to add a
warning:

** Most of the current keyservers in use on the net today do not
handle multiple subkeys properly.  The subkeys get mangled together
and corrupted. **

Worse, most of the keyservers synchronize with other keyservers, so
even if you send your key to one of the good ones, it can end up on
the bad ones as well and get corrupted.

Obviously this doesn't affect your local copy or anyone you send your
key to directly, but anyone who gets it off one of the bad keyservers
will get a corrupted key.

Go to the archive and see my response to "executing from the web" that
I posted on February 12.
(I assume that the form you are referring to is a web form).
You need to give write permission to the username that the web server is
using , not to gpg. This is often the user
"nobody", but this varies from system to system.
Another tip is to add "2>errorfile" to your gpg command. The errorfile
will probably give you some valuable
information.

Good luck,
Bill Carini

ELG sign/encrypt keys is not supported by PGP (except 658ckt06)

unlike GPG, PGP does not allow to select to which subkey to encrypt,
PGP always encrypts to newest one.

I'm not sure, but I think GPG will sign with subkey by default if there is one.

it's enough with signing subkeys.
but again PGP cannot verify signatures made with subkeys
(except 658ckt07 and maybe 7.x(but I'm not sure about it))

yes. normally.

different passprase can also be set (at least with 658ckt06),
I think it's wery cool furture :)

GPG also can use different passprase for key and subke(s),
but it's difficult to set different passprases with GPG,
for example, if you have 2 subkeys, you have to:

export to file0
delete subkey 2
set passphrase 1
export to file1
delete key
import from file0
delete subkey 1
set passphrase 2
export to file2
delete subkey 2
set passphrase 0
import from file1
import from file2
wipe file0, file1, file2

now the key will be protected with passprase 0, subkeys with passprases 1 and 2 :)

Message-ID: <0f56447cc6afe71da0d77b387651040f3c7f9f70@fchn.com>

I was really thinking of 2 ELG sign/encrypt sub-keys instead of the 2 ELG
encrypt sub-keys and the 2 DSA sign sub keys.  However, there was some note
about the ELG sign/encrypt being depreciated.  I'm not sure what that really
means in this case but the dictionary definition implied this was a bad
thing!

The more comments I read, the closer I come to believing the best bet is a
key set for work and a totally separate key set for home.  Or more
precisely, a personal set and a business set.

Now, it does appear to me that the default mechanism GPG uses to build the
keys (a DSA sign pair and an ELG encrypt pair as a sub-key) really does lend
itself to keeping the DSA around as long as possible while putting a life on
the ELG sub-keys.  

However, if the authorities came and asked for my decrypting key, I'm not
sure I'd know how to pull only the ELG sub key (private piece) out to give
to them without also letting them have the DSA private key.

--Steve

PS  Thanks for everybody who has chipped in on this discussion as it sure
has increased my understanding of the black box.

In this particular case, it means "Don't use these." :) ElGamal
signatures are somewhat controversial.

Yes.  That's a good thing, as the DSA primary (plus your user ID) is
what ties you into the web of trust.  You'd want that key to stay
around for a long time, if not forever.

You can do it with "gpg --export-secret-subkeys".

However, that allows the authorities to decrypt everything sent to
that key (which is a reason right there to change your encryption key
every now and then).  You can reveal the session key for a single
message with --show-session-key.

Seriously, though - if that happens, call a lawyer before you do
anything, and then call the EFF.

Don't do this. I did this once and still regret (my experiences with 'legacy
v3 key' are a dim echo of this past). It complicates your web of trust
position, you have two set of user-ids to gather signatures, you never know
if your correspondent has the right key on and generally the hassle is
significant. And significantly bigger than for single key.

Hmm.  This whole thread started because of somebody's desire to secure =
their
home communication versus their work site communication.  It really has=
 been
a learning experience.  Your and David's helpful comments throughout th=
is
process have shed a lot of light.  So, if I have read everything correc=

it sounds like the general consensus is:
*  Have one signing only key pair -- the master set (most likely DSA of=

appropriate strength for long term usage).
*  Have one encryption sub-key (until most keyservers understand and
correctly handle multiple sub-keys) that is changed every so often.
*  Expose only the session-level key if possible when given a court ord=
er
(with appropriate legal counsel).
*  If must expose the encryption sub-key, then generate a new pair for
future use (and change it more often) and revoke the prior sub-key pair=
,

I guess this still doesn't answer the one individual's concern about wa=

to have business and personal encryption different in case a court orde=

forced exposure of one or the other key.  Sounds like we need to wait f=

This is a good idea.  We might want so setup a webpage to further
explain this and to tell people of forthcoming keyserver networks
without this problem.

Announcing the 0.1.0 (initial) release of keystory:

keystory, by analyzing email history, gathers data on the usage of OpenPGP
signatures, and provides information to imperfectly, but practically
complement the web of trust, answering questions such as "What keys has
foo@bar.baz.com used, where and when?"

The homepage for keystory is at:
http://keystory.sourceforge.net/

tar.gz's and RPM's can be found at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42442

I have put up a demo of keystory having a CGI interface at
http://palanthas.neverending.org/keystory/

The demo site contains information gathered from the gnupg-users and
gnupg-devel archives.

keystory requires Python 2.2 or later, GnuPG, and other Python modules
that are described in the README.


>From the NEWS file:

Noteworthy changes in 0.1.0
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

    *   Initial release of keystory.

    *   Current issues are that there is no  recognition of
        duplicately imported data and compile time is slow.

I do not want to seem to attack PGP developers et al, but why the hell this
(very important IMO) feature wasn't publicized then?

Hmm.  Personal preference, I think.

For me, I always felt it was better to seperate my work life from my
personal life - that means two email addresses, two different keys,
etc.  There is inevitable overlap, of course, but it works well for me
that way.  It also works better if the company requires things like a
company revocation key, or worse, a company ADK.  I wouldn't want that
on my personal key.

In the USA, at least, I have read about possible legal issues with
regards to the boundaries between private and company communications.
If I send a private email from a company email address, the company
can under some circumstances ask for a copy of it.  (I am not a
lawyer, laws are different everywhere, etc.)

Yes.  The algorithm is up to you and what you trust more.  GnuPG 1.0.7
gives you the choice between DSA and RSA.  They each have advantages
and disadvantages.

Problem here.  If your key is already on the bad keyservers, adding a
new subkey will trigger the bug.  Even if you remove the old subkey
first, it doesn't leave the keyservers.

Yes.

I heard about this a few months ago (I think you were the one who told
me, actually), but I don't really see a large benefit here.  All it
means is that your new key is one certification depth "hop" closer
than it would be otherwise.  Is that really such a big benefit?

GnuPG does not do this, incidentally.

Hello,
 I am having some serious troubles with subkeys. I have created two
subkeys for my key 13300731. I have also revoked two. I can not get them
to be imported into another keyring (the one on my laptop). I have tried
everything i think. Here is the output on my main machine:

Secret key is available.

Then one my laptop:

gpg: Total number processed: 3
gpg:       secret keys read: 3

Now when I do gpg --edit-key 13300731 on my laptop

gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey 69F66200 - ignoring

Thanks. At least from section 8.1 it doesn't seem that RSA keys have any=20
advantages (except the backwards compatibility with plain PGP 2.x).

Hi, 

For several years I have been using PGP but as NAI has stopped 
further development I decided to look into GnuPG. I am completely 
new to GnuPG and it took me several hours to get it working because 
there is a small inaccuracy in the file readme.w32: 

It says quote 4. If you did not use the default directory 
"c:\gnupg", you     should enter a string with the directory into 
the Registry     under the key: 	 
\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG\HomeDir     Please use 
forward slashes and not the backslashes when     setting filenames 
for GnuPG into the Registry. unquote 

Since my C:\ drive is FAT32 I find it unreliable for storing files 
such as those of GPG and do so on an NTFS drive. 

Today I downloaded GnuPG 1.0.6 and GPGShell for Windows v. 2.25 and 
the QDGPG plugin for Pegasus Mail. I couldn't get any of these to 
work okay until I found the page 
http://www.jumaros.de/rsoft/gpg/guide.html 

The problem is there shouldn't be a Regkey 
\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG\HomeDir 
but rather 
\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG 
with a string value called "HomeDir" containing as data the path to 
the GPG.exe directory. 

Moreover the mention that forward slashes must be used is 
unnecessary and un-windows like: backward slashes work fine. 

HTH

I assume you're using a *nix type system. If so, the first time you type
gpg --gen-key a ~/.gnupg directory will be created (if it does not already
exist). All your keys will be stored in there.

When I write forward slash, I mean forward slash.  Backslashes may

To the best of my knowledge, on your original system you'd do:
   gpg  --armor -o mysecret.asc --export-secret-keys  myemail@myemail.net
   gpg  --armor -o mypubkey.asc --export  myemail@myemail.net

and on the second system (if you have gpg) do:
   gpg  --allow-secret-key-import  --import  mysecret.asc
   gpg  --import  mypubkey.asc

Note that the 'mysecret.asc' text file contains only the secret part
of your key, and you need to transfer both the public and private
parts to make the key behave properly on the new system.

But the very first time (when gnupg creates the .gnupg directory), it=20

The thing that comes to mind immediately for me is that you should allow
for a 64-bit key-ID search.

When 32-bit key ID collisions occur, you may want your key server to
display a warning in the user-interface.

Remember that 32-bit collisions could be accidental, so not reporting them
would prevent the distribution of legitimate keys. (And you mention the
possibility of an intential DOS.)

I personally think that public key servers should do little more than
accept, store, and report data that it contains. Preventing the display of
keys with duplicate IDs steps over that line a bit too much for me.

I strongly agree with Len on this.  Since the user's program must
validate the keys via signatures anyway, a keyserver does not need to,
and should not try to work out valid or invalid keys.

A quick look at the list of duplicate key ids seems to show that they
are all old-style v3 RSA keys which are known to have a problem with
having easy to create arbitrary 32 *or* 64-bit key ids.  Did I miss
any v4 keys on the list?

Creating a matching key id with the newer v4 key format requires
either brute force creating keys until the key id matches, or breaking
SHA-1, a problem that may not be impossible someday, but is difficult
to the point of effectively impossible today.

All that said, the 64-bit OpenPGP keyid space is very large but not
infinite.  There are going to be naturally occuring collisions
eventually (plus, one can certainly generate a v3 RSA key with the
same key id (but not fingerprint) as a v4 key).  This should be
harmless since the keys are validated based on the signatures and not
on anything the keyserver does or does not do.

If a duplicated keyid is requested from the current HKP and NAI LDAP
keyservers, *all* matching keys are returned.  This is the correct
behavior, as it lets the receiving program and the user decide which
(if any) of the returned keys is the right one.

I'm in search of a compiled Version of gnupg 1.0.6 for SGI 
IRIX 6.5 (MIPS3).

My rented Webspace is only on a shared Host and there is no 
compiler available for me. - So maybe someone could help me 
out and make a compiled version of gpg 1.0.6. available for 
me.

... and yes, I know:
* there is a precompiled 1.0.2 version available at 
http://gnupg.unixsecurity.com.br - but it has a insecure 
random key generator .. and I'm looking for 1.0.6.
* it's not such a good idea to have an encryption software 
compiled and provided by someone I don't know personally - 
but it's for my own personal privacy and not for comerical use

best wishes

I think all (most?) keyservers allows this.
some even allows search by fingerprint.

exactly. there are about 1600000 keys on server ( http://www.dtype.org/keyanalyze/ )
it's more than enough for birthday paradox.
81 keys with duplicate keyid are normal, some of them are DEADBEAFed of course.

IMO, keyserver SHOULD NOT accept keys/userid that are not selfsigned.

note that this FAQ was written when there was only v3 RSA keys.

RSA keys have some advantages, at least two:
 they are not limited to 1024 bits like DSA
 they can use hash longer than 160 bits.

This is true, and important - v4 RSA keys do not have most of the
disadvantages of v3 RSA keys.  Specifically in section 8.1, statements
#2, #3, #4, #5 (mostly), and #6 do not apply to v4 RSA keys.

Also, v4 RSA is not directly backwards compatible with v3 RSA without
doing significant packet munging magic.

RSA signing keys, that is.

For me, the worst thing about RSA signing keys is that they make much
larger signatures than a DSA key.  All in all, that's not such a big
problem these days. :)

With all due respect Armin, the instructions exactly as you have listed
do not exist in the "man page". What you have typed is a reflection of
your expertise in using GPG... not something you get by reading the
Manual once. ;o)

BTW, why does GnuPG use terms like "foo" and "man page"? The terms are

"foo" doesn't even exist?=20

That's interesting.  The gpg.info file is actually missing
double-dashes in quite a few places.

The master gpg.sgml has it right, and the gpg.1 man page file
(generated from gpg.sgml) also has it right.  The gpg.info file is
generated from gpg.texi which is generated from gpg.sgml, but it has
it wrong.  Maybe something in the docbook-to-texinfo stuff?

"man page" refers to a page in the online Unix manual.  For example,
"man gpg" gives you the manual for gpg.

As for 'foo':  http://www.tf.hut.fi/cgi-bin/jargon?search=3Dfoo

There is a bug in docbook2texi which I fixed using sed, seems that a
g is missing at the end of the repalcement pattern.  The proper way
would be to fix this in docbook2texi, though.

%.texi : %.xml

	docbook2texi $< | sed 's,--,---,' >$@
else
	: Warning: missing docbook to texinfo tools, cannot make $@
	touch $@

Not that much, at least for man page.

> I've never even heard the term man page before...

You have never used an Unix-like system, that's why. Man pages are the
main source of documentation on an Unix-like system. They are then
accessed with "man name_of_command". For example, the man page of gpg
is summoned up with the command "man gpg". There are graphical
interfaces for man pages, too, but I never used one.

> "foo" doesn't even exist?=20

foo, bar, fubar, baz are usual terms in the hacker community for
metavariable. When you need some name for the sake of the example, you
take foo. If you need two names, you take foo and bar. Three, foo, bar
and baz.

Look at the jargon file =F7)

Huh?

  foo
  
     <jargon> /foo/ A sample name for absolutely anything,
     especially programs and files (especially {scratch files}).
     First on the standard list of {metasyntactic variables} used
     in {syntax} examples.  See also {bar}, {baz}, {qux}, {quux},
     {corge}, {grault}, {garply}, {waldo}, {fred}, {plugh},
     {xyzzy}, {thud}.
  
     The etymology of "foo" is obscure.  When used in connection
     with "bar" it is generally traced to the WWII-era Army slang
     acronym {FUBAR}, later bowdlerised to {foobar}.


  FUBAR
          Fouled / Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition / Repair (slang, Usenet, IRC)

  FUBAR
  
     1. (WWII military slang) Fucked up beyond all
     recognition (or repair).


I'm not sure how you came up with mathematical functions out of
that... :)

ttyl,

Hi,
please, how to change order of uids
(Please CC me, I'm not on the list. Thanks)

I mean I have a key eg.:
(1) test-01 test-01@foo.com
(2) test-02 test-02@foo.com
(3) test-03 test-03@bar.com

ut I need this order:
(1) test-03 test-03@bar.com
(2) test-01 test-01@foo.com
(3) test-02 test-02@foo.com

I know that it is possible with some hack
(and is planned for next release of gpg as regular option)
(I even did it in past),
but I fool lost the page describing it :-(
Just an URL describing it will be fine.

Thanks for help

They do :-) But you are right that there is nothing like a man page on
a windows system. You can find an online version of the GPG man(ual)
page at: http://www.gnupg.org/gpgman.html
Somewhere down the list of options you find "--export-secret-keys"
Others have already pointed out that it is enough to type "man gpg" on
a *nix box to get this information.

I didn't mean to offend, just to point him to where he can find
further information about all command-line options of gpg. That's why
I gave him the answer in addition to the hint to have a look at the
gpg docs.

Hope we can end this thread and have all learned something :-)

Sorry, but there's no gender bias here.  "man" is simply short for
manual and is in character for all the other short and (seemingly)
meaningless commands within the unix environment.

Of course these days with everything GUI or web based, who needs command
line commands? :-)

If you don't need to build the binary from the source,
this was meant by "special setup", you can install it
without any additional steps.

Since man is really more of a UNIX thing, perhaps it would be better to
rename gpg.man in Windows to something with a .txt extension. It would
make it obvious to Windows users that this is a readable text file then.

Also, if you use Cygwin, you can install the man page to be displayed

Hello GPG world,

I'm experimenting with GPG, after using several versions of PGP 
over the years.  I installed GPG 1.0.6 on a linux box and imported 
my keyring into GPG.

Several of the keys I imported had more than one user name string 
(typically different email addresses, but also other info).  For 
some reason GPG displays for most of these keys another string as
the primary key name than PGP used to do.

Is there a reason for this?
Did I do something wrong?
Can I change this?

Is it a FAQ?  (I couldn't find it in the FAQ files and other docs, 
but perhaps I overlooked it, searched for the wrong keyword, or so)

Thanks in advance.

P.S. Please answer (also) by CC'ing me; I'm not a member of 
this mail list.

Met Vriendelijke Groeten,
Jon Krom

Yes, I realise that... but not exactly as was initially indicated:

> 
> To export secret keys:
> gpg -a -o seckey.asc --export-secret-keys <KEYID>

and that was the point I was trying to make... the "-a" and "-o"
specifically.

Yes.  GnuPG makes the (reasonable) assumption that the most recently
added (actually the most recently self-signed, but that usually means
most recently added) user ID is the primary one.

> Did I do something wrong?

Nope.

> Can I change this?

Yes.  In a few weeks, GnuPG 1.0.7 will come out with a command
("primary") to mark whichever user ID you like as primary.

A few months ago, I posted a different way to do the same thing.  You
can read that here:

But it will work without the "-a" and "-o" as well. Just you get a
binary data format (there might be problems transmitting it) and the
output will go to standard output.

Create your own script file called gpg_decrypt and accept the file name you
want to decrypt (without the .pgp extension)

#!/bin/ksh
#gpg_decrypt

echo "my pass phrase here" | gpg --homedir /etc/gnupg/homdir --passphrase-fd
0 --no-tty --output "$1" --decrypt "$1.pgp"

NOTE:  The quotes around $1 allow the file name to contain embedded spaces.
Embedded spaces in file names seems to be natural to Windows boxes.  It
causes havoc to Unix type scripts unless you are very careful to allow for
the spaces.

Or, just change your key to not have a pass phrase at all.

This is exactly the reason for recommending the use of "no password"
over "password in script" for automated systems. The latter doesn't
really give anything more than a false sense of security (and a more
complicated script) in this context.

I'd never do this for my personal key.  But for the corporate one running on
the internal corporate GnuPG server where everybody who has access to the
machine can read the plain text anyway....

Now, I don't leave the pass phrase as plain text but the methods I use to
"hide" it are easily broken (otherwise I'd have to actually encrypt it with
another passphrase).  It at least keeps the causual observer somewhat at
bay.

Well, yeah.  Of course it's insecure! :)

Which is why if you're doing this, you might as well use a key with no
password...

Usually this happens when you invoke gpg for the first time for user
"peter". Run the command again to create the key.

so i modified my script:gpg --no-default-keyring
--secret-keyring ./foo.sec --keyring ./foo.pub

I understand what you want to achieve. And I just reproduced your
problem on 1.0.3 and 1.0.6. The error message is the same as you get.
It's even the same if I create the keyring by manually choosing the
different options (no batch mode)

Sorry that I can't help you!

However, wwwkeys.us.pgp.net returned this message:

Your key block contained 1 format errors,

Found a solution.  I had to import the public key from the keyserver, then
import my revoke certificate and export the updated key back to the

Hi,

Is there a way to decript files without having to type my private

gpg -o file.txt --decrypt file.txt.gpg

Gpg needs the private password to decrypt. Is there a way to put this
password inside a file and do the command above without the need to put the
password?? Or is there another command that i can do it???


Thank you.

I see you are using Outlook, so you can use one of the Win32 front-ends
for GnuPG such as WinPT or GPGShell in which you can cache the
passphrase for a certain period of time.

This is asked about once a day.  I thought it was twice today -- but noticed
that the other one was actually yesterday!

1.  Don't use a pass phrase at all!  When it asks for a pass phrase just hit
the enter key.  See the man page (gpg text file for windows folks) regarding
the --edit option.  This is just as secure as the 2nd option and requires
less scripting changes.

2.  Feed the passphrase in your script via the echo command as in:
     echo "my pass phrase here" \
       | gpg --homedir /etc/gnupg/homdir --passphrase-fd 0 --no-tty --output
myoutfile --decrypt myinfile.pgp

This is korn shell syntax and subject to slight changes for Windows batch
files.

Message-ID: <m16j67c-000158C@bofh.torun.pl>

I try to add new UiD to my key and after 'save' gpg reports:

Command> save
gpg: /home/alex/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: copy to
/home/alex/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.tmp' failed: file read error
gpg: update failed: file read error

What to do in such a situation? I think of exporting all the keys then
rebuilding the pubring from scratch, but this way local signatures will get
lost.

Youre too late. GPG is available for the Windows commandline, and using 
the IDEA module it is PGP 2.6x compatible.

There are a couple of Windows front ends available (IMHO better than 
anything in Linux, particularly GPGShell) and a number of MUAs (Becky, 
The Bat, Pegasus, Outlook Express, Eudora, etc) have a plugin to use 
GPG in Windows.

What more do you want?

What was wrong with your code didn't pop out at me immediately, but I'd
recommend trying out GnuPG::Interface to help relieve some of the
headaches: http://gnupg-interface.sourceforge.net/

You may want to try something like this:

 open FILE, "|gpg --batch --no-tty --passphrase-fd 0 --armor --symmetric 2>> $stderr > $stdout" or die "Cannot gpg";
 print FILE "passphrase\n";
 print FILE "text to be encrypted\n";
 close FILE;

Message-ID: <86.17920886.29ba2059@aol.com>

Hello,

Looking for help.  

Running PGP 6.02 PGP, 2.6.3ia-multi05 and GNUPG 1.06.  Messages generated 
with any version of PGP, no problem; however encrypted messages created with 
GNUPG crash with a "bad session key" error if opened in PGP.  I have RTFM, or 
FAQ, but I can see nothing about such an error or how to address/fix.

Does this have any relationship to the fact that I am sending test messages 
to other useids that are also on my secret keyring (from me to me as it were)?

Any ideas as how to fix or explain

Please respond or CC off list.

Thanks.

Matthew

Are you using a front-end at all with GnuPG? The reason I ask is that in
my experience... limited as it may be... an error message like that
related to the Session Key usually indicate that the message was
encrypted with an Algo that is not supported on the receiving machine's
copy of PGP.

I think GnuPG defaults to 3DES if a common Algo cannot be found (while
PGP will default to either CAST5 or 3DES depending on version), but
sometimes when using a front-end you can 'force' GnuPG to use an
Algorithm regardless of the preferences found on the Public Key to which
you are encrypting. That may even be possible without using a front-end
by the option --cipher-algo <name>.

Not the problem since PGP uses Cast5 and 3Des.  I have "corrected" the 
problem using the 6.02 generated keys by adding "emulate-md-encode-bug" to 
the Options file but still no luck with my old RSA keys.

Thanks

Yes I know, but doesn't --cipher-algo <name> in essence over ride the
default, and literally 'forces' GnuPG to use the Algorithm specified,
regardless what the Recipients preferences are?

Message-ID: <E16jQ1v-0005lG-00@porta.u64.de>

Hi, 
how does the changing of the passphrase work? 
As it is possible to change the passphrase that means (to me) that the 
secretKey "knows" the passphrase.

In detail:

If i create a new key and set the password to e.g. "supersecret_1" and 
put a copy of that secretKey somewhere, than i change the passphrase to 
"supersecret_2".
Am i right that it's now possible to use the first secretKey with the 
first passphrase  for signing/encryption  AS  WELL  AS  the second 
secretKey with its passphrase..?

Regards, dominik

Subject: Decrypt files with embedded filenames
Message-ID: <200203081954.NAA21094@phylum.teldta.com>

I was running into the use-embedded-filename option not working also on
Solaris using 1.0.6 and here's what I came up with:

The decrypt_message() call in decrypt.c causes opt.outfile to be set to '-'
since we assume --outfile isn't needed.  In plaintext.c the check for
opt.outfile is before the !opt.use_embedded_filename in handle_plaintext()
and use_embedded_filename is never used.

Fix:

Change decrypt.c line 70 from 

if ( !opt.outfile )

to

if ( !opt.outfile && !opt.use_embedded_filename )

Hope this helps.

The secret key is encrypted by the passphrase.  Therefore, to use the secret
key you must supply the pasphrase that is used to decrypt it.  That's why
the passphrase needs to be longer than a single word.  

And yes, if you have two different secret keyrings each having your secret
key but secured by two different passphrases, then each will work as you
described.

Subject: PGP 7.0.3 refuses to encrypt with my key
Message-ID: <3C895CDB.29494.1A1E86@localhost>

Hi,

I tried to encrypt some message with PGPfreeware 7.0.3 with my GnuPG 1.0.6-
created key, but PGP could not encrypt the message with my key: "An error has 
occured: key can't be used for encryption".

I read in the FAQ about problems with older versions that refused to encrypt 
with ElGamal type-20 keys. But mine is a type-16 key, so this should be a 
different problem. Signing with PGP works and is also no problem with GPG.
What can I do?  Thanks.

Volker

My example oversimplified things a bit. My program
is actually meant to feed printer files via email
to a remote printer (in parts if necessary). So it
really needs a separate program like you suggest to
prepend the passphrase.

I am actually doing it this way now - building and
invoking a separate perl program on the fly - and
it is working very well.  But it seems a bit kludgey.
So I thought "There has to be a better way .." 

Perhaps there isn't!

Thanks for your help.

You may want to try something like this:

 open FILE, "|gpg --batch --no-tty --passphrase-fd 0 --armor --symmetric
2>> $stderr > $stdout" or die "Cannot gpg";
 print FILE "passphrase\n";
 print FILE "text to be encrypted\n";
 close FILE;

1) The thing that comes to mind immediately for me is that you should
allow for a 64-bit key-ID search.

2) The public key servers should do little more than accept, store,
and report data that it contains. Preventing the display of keys with
duplicate IDs steps over that line a bit too much for me.


David Shaw:

3) If a duplicated keyid is requested from the current HKP and NAI
LDAP keyservers, *all* matching keys are returned.  This is the
correct behavior, as it lets the receiving program and the user decide
which (if any) of the returned keys is the right one.

---

1) 64-bit KeyID will be supported. It's easy and no problem in server. 
But I'm wondering how PGP/GPG user know their own 64-bit KeyID.

2) HKP protocol based HTTP/1.0 is not define the waring status for the
found duplicate key. We should define some specifications for
duplicate keys.  This specification is not only problem of public key
server(s) but also problem of OpenPGP client(s) a.k.a PGP and GPG.

3) I think "all matching keys are returned" solution is not a perfect
idea. But I can support it easly for my public key server.  I'd like
to know how about this solution for PGP or GPG.

GPG uses 64-bit keyids internally, so even though most people don't
know their own 64-bit keyid, when someone does a --refresh-keys
command or a key is retrieved automatically because of the
--auto-key-retrieve option the 64-bit keyid can be used.

Even so, the user can see their 64-bit keyid by adding the
"--with-colons" option to the usual --list-keys or --list-sigs

I'd even like to be able to search by fingerprint.  The way I see it,
since the 32-bit keyid is just the lowest 32 bits of the fingerprint,
and the 64-bit keyid is just the lowest 64 bits of the fingerprint,
the keyserver must calculate the fingerprint no matter what.  Since
it's already calculated, it would be nice to use it.

If you don't think this is the right way to go, what do you suggest as
an alternative?  I think a warning is fine, but not returning one of
the keys leaves the keyserver open for a denial of service attack.

Yes, this is a good idea.

Agreed -- a warning is warranted, but the key server software shouldn't be
deciding not to report keys simply because they share key-ids with other
keys.

I'd like to return only "Found duplicate keys" status to client. If
keyserver returns all of duplicate key contents to client, it can be
used another DoS attack.

Then, user can select two thing which are retrieve by 64-bit keyid or
via Web interface.

User may access an exact key via Web interface with database OID
number (this numbers are not appeared to user) to check key contents
and get it by their own risk.

Fyi: http://openpksd.org prepare Kaz's "pgpdump" interface to see
internal of key contents.

How?

The user does not know if any key from a keyserver is valid or not.
Even if an attacker creates hundreds of duplicate keys, it does not
matter since the signatures are what is used to check if the key is
valid.

It is easy to make even a duplicate 64-bit keyid.  If the keyserver
makes the user go through many extra steps to get a key if there is a
duplicate keyid, then that is a (mild) denial of service as well.

Exactly. (I hate to keep harping on this, but...) Key servers should be
storage devices. Let the user figure out if the key should be trusted or
not.

Agreed. We shouldn't make this harder than it has to be for the user.

I do like the idea of warning the user that multiple keys were returned,
though -- but the more I think about it, the more I think that that
warning should occur client-side.

 Step 0: If you use 32bit keyid, move Step 1. If 64bit keyid, move 
	 Step 2.

 Step 1: If you try to get a key by 32bit keyid but found duplicate keys,
	 move Step 2 or Step 3 which you wish.

 Step 2: If you try to get a key by 64bit keyid but found duplicate
         keys, move Step 3 or Step 4 which you wish.

         If 32bit duplicate keyid was generated by accidentally, 
	 64bit keyid searching will help most of them. 

 Step 3: Use Web interface and check a list of keyids combined
         fingerprints. Select one key and database will return actual
         key (using database OID). Users must be patients. So, some
         people like me move to Step 4.

 Step 4: Ask an actual public key for the key owner or get an public
         key from owner's web page.

> then that is a (mild) denial of service as well.

Yes, I know it. Please remember that the concept of "Web of Trust"
doesn't need any keyserver nor certificate authority. "No keyserver"
is default.

Not if the server displays a terse list of all the keys from which the
user can choose the desired key. Additionally there could be some cron
jobs running on the server once a week or something that searches for
duplicated fake keys and reports to the maintainer. But then we have
the "problem" of getting the same key back again when some of the other
key servers reinstall the key. If we were to get rid of obvious faked
keys, they should be disabled on the server, but I doubt this a big
enough problem to make any special arrangements for it.

IMHO the danger of DoS attacks due to duplicate 32-bits keyIDs is not
very big. If there were lots of keys showing up as duplicates, there
would not be a significant amount of resources needed from the server.
Waste of bandwith, yes, but I don't think it would result in a DoS
situation. But then, I have no clue of the inner workings of the server
software, so please correct me if I'm wrong. :-)

I think the option of specifying the fingerprint is a good idea. Not
necessarily the whole bunch of bits, just enough to make it unique.

This is where the fingerprint comes to use. To ensure you have the key
belonging to the actual user, there has to be some additional
communication to verify that it's not someone who has generated a key
with a false name on it. Even if a false key is used, the only problem
is that the receiver can't read the encrypted message. (I take it for
granted that the sender knows the receivers actual email address.) This
could lead to a mess and could be a problem. I don't know of any
methods to avoid this problem, except spreading your fingerprint
actively to make it easier for other people to verify the authenticity
of the key. The keys from a keyserver is genuine 99% of the time, but
there is always a chance someone has made his own key with the same
name on it.

Shouldn't the internal CRC routines help avoiding this? I doubt it
would be an easy task to duplicate the 64-bit key _and_ satisfy the
SHA1 checksum.

Not much of extra steps needed here, just a list of all the keys to
choose from. One extra step.

Another thing is when GPG itself gets the key from a server, for
example when verifying a signed text and you don't have the actual key
from before. Will GPG then use the 32-bit keyID to get the key from the
server?

just a question out of curiosity:
what's the key size for Blowfish encryption?
is it 256 bit?
... for both cipher-algo and s2k-cipher-algo
(if defined so in the options file or at the

Yes, because the current HKP servers can't cope with the full 64 bit
keyID.  I'd even like to have a keyserver which accepts the
fingerprint.  The problem here is that the signature packet does only
carry the 64 bit key ID.

This is an algorithm that a human being can follow.  What is a program
supposed to do?  Most people do not use a web interface to get their
keys - they use the keyserver interface in their application, which
can only say "give me 0xXXXXXXXX".  It should not have to parse and
understand lots of HTML to try and resolve conflicts.  Also, PGP is
not being updated anymore.  Even if code is added to GnuPG to talk to
your keyserver, PGP will not be able to.

Let me try and approach this from another direction: do you see any
security problem with returning more than one key with the same keyid?
If yes, can you tell me why?

Remember that the keyserver does nothing to validate the keys - that
is the job of the signatures on the key.  The decision on whether to
use a particular key belongs to the *user* who verifies the signatures
and decides where this key fits into the web of trust.  One of the
main reasons for key signatures in the first place is to deal with
this exact problem.  There can never be a denial of service by
generating a fake key with the same keyid because of the signatures.

Only if the keyserver can only handle 32-bit keyids.  If GPG is
talking to a server that can handle more (like the LDAP server), it
will use the full 64-bits.  (Werner, this is one of the things I added
in the generic keyserver code :) )

Is there any way from stopping this.

hi

here's a bug report / rant? for GPG 1.0.6

documentation is missing for 

     --check-trustdb [NAMES]      check the trust database
     --fix-trustdb                fix a corrupted trust database

these options don't know show up in the man page. someone really ought to do 
the grunt work of cross-checking the man page documentation with the actual 
options that gpg can accept.

these are not in the handbook nor in the FAQ either. the only thing i could 
find was stuff in the mailing-lists. in particular, i cannot help but wonder, 
why would my trustdb become corrupted, and how is it possible that it can be 
fixed (and if so, why doesn't it do that by itself?).  besides, i cannot 
figure out how to use check-trustdb, all i get is output like this:

tadora:~$ gpg --check-trustdb blais
gpg: given user IDs ignored in check_trustdb
gpg: 15 keys processed
gpg:    15 keys skipped
tadora:~$ 


also of interest:
    --allow-secret-key-import

is not mentioned on the output of "gpg --help". i'm sure there are many 
others.

i know it is not fun to do, but documentation improvement for this otherwise 
excellent piece of software is sorely needed. encryption attracts people who 
will have attention for detail and will read up on how it works, will 
experiment with it before using it, and it would be nice if the documentation 
was very, very, very consistent (it is off to a very good start, but the 
mising stuff is frustrating).

another big one (for me and other friends): the default behaviour for "gpg 
file.gpg" is to decrypt to a file "file", and apart from asking for the 
passphrase it doesn't say it has output the PLAINTEXT to a FILE. the user 
that is not careful might forget or not know that is unencrypted document 
lies in the filesystem!  that is a big problem!  IMHO that should not be the 
default behaviour, the default, just as for input, should be that it outputs 
to stdout, just like --decrypt does, and that using --decrypt should output 
to a file (plus we should get a message that says so, every functionality 
that write unencrypted data to the filesystem should warn the user).


thanks for making gpg, i really enjoy using it otherwise.
cheers,

There are reasons for this.  --dump-options is for example also not
listed in the man page.  But hey, you have the source, so where is the
problem.

So don't use it.  As said, there is a reason that it is not listed.
BTW, the next version has it mentioned because this command has a real
use then.

If you try to import a secret key, a messge is printed, telling you to
use this option.  Anyway, this option is just a temporary hack and not
anymore needed in 1.0.6d.  Printing all 202 commands and options with
--help make no sense, it is just too much and can't probably not be
understood without a more verbose description.  Anyway, recent
versions do print:

      --photo-viewer               Set command line to view Photo IDs
   -N, --notation-data NAME=VALUE   use this notation data

  (See the man page for a complete listing of all commands and options)


There is nothing important missing, some things are maintainer only.
If you or the people attracted by encryption real want to get into it,
use the source.

Which is the correct behaviour of a Unix tool.  Use --verbose to get
what you want.

A lot of tools do have this behaviour and it makes a lot of sense. IF
you want to have the output on stdout, send the input to stdin.

Ciao,

This can easily be avoided by using

    gpg <file.gpg

The output will then be sent to stdout. IMHO the current behaviour of
GnuPG is correct. When specifying a file directly, GPG behaves the
similar way -- creating a file. This is the de facto way of doing
things in UNIX and I don't think that should be changed. Another
question is whether it should be changed on DOSish systems, as the
stdin/stdout thing is pretty unfamiliar in the DOS (aka windows) world.
But then it's a Bad Thing to make a program work differently in
different environments. That would lead to more trouble than it's
worth.

Talking about stdin/stdout... I have to mention the horrible behaviour
by PGP 6.x. When I get encrypted mail, most of the time as armoured
text, I mark the text in my editor (joe) and filter it through GnuPG.
Works fine. One day I tried doing the same using PGP. It read from
stdin, but it did not send the output to stdout, instead it created a
file called "stdin" or something like that in the current directory
where i started my mail program. I must say I was shocked by this. I'd
_never_ think such a widespread program could have serious flaws like
this. If i remember correctly, one have to specify an option (-f or
something) to make PGP use stdin/stdout, but I still call it a flaw. If
it doesn't print to stdout, it should neither read from stdin. Indeed
PGP acts like a strange bird in an UNIX environment.

there is no real problem, one of the users (me) is confused, and is making 
comments to the developers in order to allow them to improve the 
documentation of their software.

i'd like to know what they are? it would be nice if there was a clear 
separation between options that are shown by --help and those that aren't and 
that are explained in the man page and manual (perhaps dub them "extended" or 
"private" options?).  in any case, either the manual or documentation should 
reflect all options, right?

i understand that documentation is difficult to keep up-to-date by a 
distributed team (and the handbook is actually quite impressive), but this is 
indeed a 1.0 release and for such an important release documentation should 
be polished... i wouldn't have bothered making comments for a development 
release, because i understand that. my own system is that i make it a 
requirement to releasing, i.e. i don't allow myself to release until i've 
updated the docs. if i want to release something i have to bite the bullet 
and slave at the docs.

(and besides, sorry, but looking at the source doesn't qualify as 
documentation, which is what my comments are about. the beauty of oss is that 
i can if i want to (especially to make modifications), but that doesn't mean 
that all users of gpg SHOULD have to become acquainted with the source to 
find out what an option listed in --help is meant to do. i'm sure you'll 
agree with this.)

well, it IS indeed listed in "gpg --help".  i didn't mean to use it, i meant 
to understand what it does because it was listed, and is not documented, and 
that is why i was trying it. if i'm not meant to use it, then the problem is 
that it was listed.

that's exactly my point!  is at least the man page complete? options that are 
listed in --help should at least also be in the man page. the opposite is not 
necessarily true, and some kind of grouping to acknowledge that is a nice way 
to let the user understand this (something like "basic options" and "extended 
options").

those maintainer-only options should then not be visible to the user if he's 
not to use them. all i'm arguing for, is that the maintainer/for-debug 
options be somehow marked as such or not visible.

agreed, read on...

i know i can use --decrypt and i do now (actually, you make me think, i'll 
try putting it in my options file).

well, please consider that a default behaviour of writing plaintext files out 
to the filesystem is behaviour that does not foster trust in a program that 
is meant to provide data security for its user. i mean, there is a reason for 
that file to be encrypted in the first place. if i considered my filesystem 
permissions to be secure i probably wouldn't use encryption to store files on 
it.

i have often forgotten to delete unencrypted files because of that (and even 
sometimes on my cd backups, which were recently robbed with the rest of the 
computing equipment. not a cool feeling. i agree that it is my fault because 
i misused gpg, but food for thought anyway. IMHO plaintext should only be 
written to files on request. consider it a security feature, and not a minor 
one---the user is less likely to make the mistake of decrypting to disk.)

thanks for your quick answer.
cheers,

good point, so i guess it cannot be changed.

perhaps an option to alter that behaviour would be cool. that option could be 
put in the user's options file to get that behaviour.

just my 2cents.

That seems like a good idea. Having an "always-stdout" option would be
a good thing to have, especially when thinking of how hard it is to
completely erase data from hard disks once it's written. After all,
it's easy to redirect the output to a file. I still think the current
behaviour should be the default, but I see no drawback in having an
configuration option to achieve this behaviour.

That page says that blowfish has a variable length key. However, according to 
RFC2440, OpenPGP uses blowfish with a 128-bit key. That applies to both the 
- --cipher-algo and --s2k-cipher-algo options.

Hi,

I decided to create a library which implements basic parts
of the RFC2440 (OpenPGP) message format. This library will
be no replacement for any real OpenPGP application like PGP
or GPG. The goals of the library are to provide an API for
parsing packets and to work with OpenPGP keys.

There is also some code for signing, verification, encrypt
and decrypt, but this is only partly done.

Some of the code based on GPG and for all crypto functions
we referring to the libgcrypt library. This library is responsible
for secure memory, random generation and other sentensive parts.

Currently the library is work on progress, but for the people
who want to take a look at it can find the source on this webpage:
http://www.winpt.org/opencdk.html

Of course the whole project is available under the terms of the 
GNU General Public License.

I checked code into CVS that will allow CKS to support HKP style 
queries by the 64 bit key ID, the full 128 bit v3 fp, or the full
160 bit V4 fp.  This feature will be available in the next release.

Here are adapted HKP protocol examples:

32 bit key ID:
GET /pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x992A4B3F HTTP/1.0

64 bit key ID:
GET /pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xFA920973992A4B3F HTTP/1.0

128 bit key ID (v3) (one line wrapped by MTA):
GET /pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0A75834DE6AB89F6BE869EB81DF4E517 HTTP/1.0

160 bit key ID (v4) (one line wrapped by MTA):
GET /pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0EC8B0E3052DFC4C208F76EBFA920973992A4B3F 
HTTP/1.0

I included fp support, because I would like to soon write PGP 
software that uses fp's to transmit key information in other
protocols. It would be nice to use CKS to auto fetch by fp as
part of that code.

I don't believe this is true.  While the potential to create 32 bit 
key id collisions easily exists in v3, it is a hard problem in v4
because the v4 keyid (both 32 and 64 bit) are part of the fingerprint
which in v4 is the SHA160 hash of the key material. So, the problem 
of generating fake keys with a given keyid in v4 is the problem of 
looking for SHA1 partial collisions.

While partial collisions will occur as the number of keys grows, it 
will not be growing fast enough to result in an inability to retrieve
all keys with a given 32bit ID from a server for many decades (even
if you dedicate a machine to generating PGP keys and sending them to
my key server).

I think this is a good thing except for one problem.  From the
perspective of a program that is making a call to a keyserver via HKP,
it has no way to know if the keyserver is pksd, CKS, or something
else.  Since only CKS supports this syntax, there is a problem.  I
guess it could try twice and fall back to the 32 bit key id if the
keyserver returns an error with a fingerprint lookup.

Something to be discussed in the RFC, I think. :)

Those are all valid concerns.  Encryption programs will have to be
modified accordingly, of course.  However, even without support for
the extensions in encryption programs, we can still benefit by having
the features available for browser-based lookups.

FWIW, it should be _very easy_ to add long keyid lookups to pks, iff we're
all willing to get back a list of keys matching the corresponding _short_
keyid.  Having pks return only matches by long keyid would require more
work, but should also be possible.  (Remember, there are 81 and 5 keys by
duplicate long and short keyids, respectively, and a maximum of 3 keys with
the same short keyid (0xDEADBEEF).)

Having pks support lookups by fingerprint would require the addition of
a new Berkeley DB Btree or Hash database file.  This should be a
straightforward (but non-trivial) programming task.

(Also, only on the pgp-keyserver-folk list, I previously announced a
proof of concept Perl program that allows lookups by fingerprints.  The
interface isn't HKP and some scripting would be required to keep the
fingerprint and keyid data current, but all sorts of improvements are
possible.  (At any rate, I'm glad to have finally gotten some positive
(though indirect) answers about the _perceived_ need for new types of
key lookups.))

> Something to be discussed in the RFC, I think. :)

As features which are optional to implement, I feel that they can go
in immediately.  I have already needed and performed lookups (mostly
non-keyserver greps on pgpring(1) output) by fingerprint and long keyid.

For browser-based lookups by human beings, fine.

For any program-driven interface, it must be discussed first.
Creating a feature that breaks compatibility with an existing server
base needs at least a minute or two of thought before doing it.

In functionality, yes.  But in security... well...  IMHO, it's ok to
just throw v3 people to the wolves - they know what they're using 
is not secure, that it is attackable, in many different ways.  The
fixes for the insecurities in v3 are what became part of v4.

People really need to upgrade and stop using anything earlier than
v4.  Trying to secure v3 is like trying to secure Windows 98 as an
internet server.

LDAP has a max results modifier on queries, I encourage people 
to code something similar into keyservers to protect against 
server side DOS's rather than return a warning or partial
results.

Retrieving by 64bit key ID was done. It is available via Web interface
from  http://www.openpksd.org/findkey/index.html

openpksd's database has 32bit<->64bit key mapping table.

It is easy to support 128 bit and 160 bit keyID. Long key reduces the
possibility of collision but I'm wondering that handing cost of
128/160 bit key ID is suitable cost for keyserver.

Some attacks are effective not only user client but also keyserver.
If keyserver found duplicate key then return "Found duplicate
key". It's OK. It's little cost.  If keyserver found duplicate key
then return all of key contents.  It is a possibility of DoS not only
user client but also keyserver. v3 is problem but we have to support.

Try
gpg --export-ownertrust > trustdb.asc

This is called console redirection and will work with most programmes.
It tells Windows (or *nix) to print all normal output not to the
screen but to a certain file. Error messages are still printed on the
screen.

&> file
will redirect normal output and error messages to "file". This works
with Linux, don't know whether it works with DOS/Windows.

gpg --import-ownertrust < trustdb.asc
should import the trust values from "trustdb.asc". This tells
Windows/*nix to read all input from the file instead of reading from
the keyboard.

Armin

Have you tried other keyservers ? There are problems with some of
them. I use horowitz.surfnet.nl (as suggested by Werner Koch some time
ago) and it works fine for me.

I look for the error message in the source code. It's produced in a
routine called "write_server" in "util/http.c" and is
Windows-specific. The error code 87 stands for
"ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER" as reported by the Windows-API function
"GetLastError".

I'm not running Windows so I can't reproduce it. Sorry that I have no
better news for you. Maybe some of the developers can make more sense
out of it.

Bye,
Armin

This can easily be avoided by using

    gpg <file.gpg

The output will then be sent to stdout. IMHO the current behaviour of
GnuPG is correct. When specifying a file directly, GPG behaves the
similar way -- creating a file. This is the de facto way of doing
things in UNIX and I don't think that should be changed. Another
question is whether it should be changed on DOSish systems, as the
stdin/stdout thing is pretty unfamiliar in the DOS (aka windows) world.
But then it's a Bad Thing to make a program work differently in
different environments. That would lead to more trouble than it's
worth.

Talking about stdin/stdout... I have to mention the horrible behaviour
by PGP 6.x. When I get encrypted mail, most of the time as armoured
text, I mark the text in my editor (joe) and filter it through GnuPG.
Works fine. One day I tried doing the same using PGP. It read from
stdin, but it did not send the output to stdout, instead it created a
file called "stdin" or something like that in the current directory
where i started my mail program. I must say I was shocked by this. I'd
_never_ think such a widespread program could have serious flaws like
this. If i remember correctly, one have to specify an option (-f or
something) to make PGP use stdin/stdout, but I still call it a flaw. If
it doesn't print to stdout, it should neither read from stdin. Indeed
PGP acts like a strange bird in an UNIX environment.

there is no real problem, one of the users (me) is confused, and is making 
comments to the developers in order to allow them to improve the 
documentation of their software.

i'd like to know what they are? it would be nice if there was a clear 
separation between options that are shown by --help and those that aren't
and 
that are explained in the man page and manual (perhaps dub them "extended"
or 
"private" options?).  in any case, either the manual or documentation should

reflect all options, right?

i understand that documentation is difficult to keep up-to-date by a 
distributed team (and the handbook is actually quite impressive), but this
is 
indeed a 1.0 release and for such an important release documentation should 
be polished... i wouldn't have bothered making comments for a development 
release, because i understand that. my own system is that i make it a 
requirement to releasing, i.e. i don't allow myself to release until i've 
updated the docs. if i want to release something i have to bite the bullet 
and slave at the docs.

(and besides, sorry, but looking at the source doesn't qualify as 
documentation, which is what my comments are about. the beauty of oss is
that 
i can if i want to (especially to make modifications), but that doesn't mean

that all users of gpg SHOULD have to become acquainted with the source to 
find out what an option listed in --help is meant to do. i'm sure you'll 
agree with this.)

well, it IS indeed listed in "gpg --help".  i didn't mean to use it, i meant

to understand what it does because it was listed, and is not documented, and

that is why i was trying it. if i'm not meant to use it, then the problem is

that it was listed.

that's exactly my point!  is at least the man page complete? options that
are 
listed in --help should at least also be in the man page. the opposite is
not 
necessarily true, and some kind of grouping to acknowledge that is a nice
way 
to let the user understand this (something like "basic options" and
"extended 
options").

those maintainer-only options should then not be visible to the user if he's

not to use them. all i'm arguing for, is that the maintainer/for-debug 
options be somehow marked as such or not visible.

i know i can use --decrypt and i do now (actually, you make me think, i'll 
try putting it in my options file).

well, please consider that a default behaviour of writing plaintext files
out 
to the filesystem is behaviour that does not foster trust in a program that 
is meant to provide data security for its user. i mean, there is a reason
for 
that file to be encrypted in the first place. if i considered my filesystem 
permissions to be secure i probably wouldn't use encryption to store files
on 
it.

i have often forgotten to delete unencrypted files because of that (and even

sometimes on my cd backups, which were recently robbed with the rest of the 
computing equipment. not a cool feeling. i agree that it is my fault because

i misused gpg, but food for thought anyway. IMHO plaintext should only be 
written to files on request. consider it a security feature, and not a minor

one---the user is less likely to make the mistake of decrypting to disk.)

thanks for your quick answer.
cheers,

good point, so i guess it cannot be changed.

perhaps an option to alter that behaviour would be cool. that option could
be 
put in the user's options file to get that behaviour.

just my 2cents.

That seems like a good idea. Having an "always-stdout" option would be
a good thing to have, especially when thinking of how hard it is to
completely erase data from hard disks once it's written. After all,
it's easy to redirect the output to a file. I still think the current
behaviour should be the default, but I see no drawback in having an
configuration option to achieve this behaviour.

That page says that blowfish has a variable length key. However, according
to 
RFC2440, OpenPGP uses blowfish with a 128-bit key. That applies to both the 
- --cipher-algo and --s2k-cipher-algo options.

Reply-To: twoaday@freakmail.de


Hi,

I decided to create a library which implements basic parts
of the RFC2440 (OpenPGP) message format. This library will
be no replacement for any real OpenPGP application like PGP
or GPG. The goals of the library are to provide an API for
parsing packets and to work with OpenPGP keys.

There is also some code for signing, verification, encrypt
and decrypt, but this is only partly done.

Some of the code based on GPG and for all crypto functions
we referring to the libgcrypt library. This library is responsible
for secure memory, random generation and other sentensive parts.

Currently the library is work on progress, but for the people
who want to take a look at it can find the source on this webpage:
http://www.winpt.org/opencdk.html

Of course the whole project is available under the terms of the 
GNU General Public License.


        Timo

I tried to send my e-mail to dshaw@jabberwocky.com from my two mail

Please let me know another your e-mail address which I can send one.

And I'm sorry for ML readers.

Howdy!

I've been trying to make sense of signatures and multiple IDs. If
someone signs my public key and I subsequently create a new ID for
that key, then it is not the case that the new ID by transitivity is
signed by the signer. This makes perfect sense: if the signer can
verify my identity as Dr. Jekyll and signs that ID, that does not mean
that he will vouch for any Mr. Hyde IDs used for eating small children
afterwards.

But then people say that creating new IDs for an old key is better
than creating an entirely new key, since creating a new key means that
I have to start collecting signatures all over again. But by doing so,
will I be that much better helped? Sure, people can see that my
_other_ IDs have been signed, but that will require more than a quick
glance, which is more than many people will give to most keys.

Am I missing something here?

I believe that you miss teh fact that key trust is calculated on per-key and
not on per-user ID basis.

Message-ID: <22FD1855C2B16C40A1F6DE406420021E0187F840@mail.bai.org>

Does anybody know what hash algorithm and symmetric cipher PGP v7.x uses on
private key material? I've tried many combinations of different cipher/hash
algorithms, but I can only seem to export a secret key and use it
successfully in PGP 7.x when it has *no* passphrase.

I've tried Blowfish/RIPEMD-160 (the GnuPG default), and all the combinations
of 3des, CAST, RIJNDAEL and SHA1, with no success.

Not really.  The trust he's talking about is not for your IDs, it's for
trusting your signatures on other people's keys.  If you've got two IDs
on your key, one very widely signed and one not signed except by
yourself your signature on other people's keys will still come into play
on the web of trust even though your second ID might not be verifiable.

The problem is the cipher. It's IDEA.

Other keyservers work fine, like wwwkeys.pgp.net .
I have a similar problem here, also with search.keyserver.net, but not allways.
See:

gpg: requesting key FBA6ECF1 from search.keyserver.net ...

gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
bart@cable-195-162-215-141:~$ 

As you can see, the first time it failed, the second time it succeeds. I'm
going to trace this, when I have some spare time. For now I use wwwkeys.pgp.net
as the default keyserver (in ~/.gnupg/options).

I'm starting to feel rather stupid now, like a fairly intelligent
bloke such as myself _should_ grok this model without even blinking. I
wonder, then, how Joe Luser then is expected to understand a word of
it, especially given an assumed very low interest in technical matters
by default.

Anyway, I digress.

I am failing to see a couple of things here. Signatures are the glue
of the web of trust model, and trust is calculated on a per-key basis,
not on a per-ID basis. Then what is the point in signing IDs? But on
the other hand, if there's no signing on a per-ID basis, then, after
getting a number of signatures, someone might create bogus IDs.

I don't think that I'm mixing up trust and signatures here... but who
knows? Signatures should be all about verifying people's identities,
but in creating a new ID, how do I avoid having to have that
particular signed all over again[1]? Needless to say, pulling keys out
of the web of trust is a Bad Thing(tm), but that doesn't seem to be
the argument that most people make when they tell you to make a new ID
rather than a new key. The current system makes relatively good sense,
but to me it doesn't seem to make _perfect_ sense. ARGH!

Martin


[1] I guess that once someone has signed your key once, and therefore
should trust that you are who you say you are, then, because they
trust your key, they'll not be reluctant to sign a reasonable new ID.

I  tried.  15  times.  Every  time  I  get the same response "No error".

Where did you get the archieve from ? I downloaded it from

email it to you privately if you want me to (it's about 1.9MB); just
tell me on my private mail.

Howdy!

I've been trying to make sense of signatures and multiple IDs. If
someone signs my public key and I subsequently create a new ID for
that key, then it is not the case that the new ID by transitivity is
signed by the signer. This makes perfect sense: if the signer can
verify my identity as Dr. Jekyll and signs that ID, that does not mean
that he will vouch for any Mr. Hyde IDs used for eating small children
afterwards.

But then people say that creating new IDs for an old key is better
than creating an entirely new key, since creating a new key means that
I have to start collecting signatures all over again. But by doing so,
will I be that much better helped? Sure, people can see that my
_other_ IDs have been signed, but that will require more than a quick
glance, which is more than many people will give to most keys.

Am I missing something here?

Martin

I believe that you miss teh fact that key trust is calculated on per-key and
not on per-user ID basis.

Subject: Cipher/hash for passphrase in PGP 7.0
Date: Mon, 11 Mar 2002 10:55:24 -0600

Does anybody know what hash algorithm and symmetric cipher PGP v7.x uses on
private key material? I've tried many combinations of different cipher/hash
algorithms, but I can only seem to export a secret key and use it
successfully in PGP 7.x when it has *no* passphrase.

I've tried Blowfish/RIPEMD-160 (the GnuPG default), and all the combinations
of 3des, CAST, RIJNDAEL and SHA1, with no success.

Not really.  The trust he's talking about is not for your IDs, it's for
trusting your signatures on other people's keys.  If you've got two IDs
on your key, one very widely signed and one not signed except by
yourself your signature on other people's keys will still come into play
on the web of trust even though your second ID might not be verifiable.

Other keyservers work fine, like wwwkeys.pgp.net .
I have a similar problem here, also with search.keyserver.net, but not
allways.
See:

gpg: requesting key FBA6ECF1 from search.keyserver.net ...

gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
bart@cable-195-162-215-141:~$ 

As you can see, the first time it failed, the second time it succeeds. I'm
going to trace this, when I have some spare time. For now I use
wwwkeys.pgp.net
as the default keyserver (in ~/.gnupg/options).

I'm starting to feel rather stupid now, like a fairly intelligent
bloke such as myself _should_ grok this model without even blinking. I
wonder, then, how Joe Luser then is expected to understand a word of
it, especially given an assumed very low interest in technical matters
by default.

Anyway, I digress.

I am failing to see a couple of things here. Signatures are the glue
of the web of trust model, and trust is calculated on a per-key basis,
not on a per-ID basis. Then what is the point in signing IDs? But on
the other hand, if there's no signing on a per-ID basis, then, after
getting a number of signatures, someone might create bogus IDs.

I don't think that I'm mixing up trust and signatures here... but who
knows? Signatures should be all about verifying people's identities,
but in creating a new ID, how do I avoid having to have that
particular signed all over again[1]? Needless to say, pulling keys out
of the web of trust is a Bad Thing(tm), but that doesn't seem to be
the argument that most people make when they tell you to make a new ID
rather than a new key. The current system makes relatively good sense,
but to me it doesn't seem to make _perfect_ sense. ARGH!

Martin


[1] I guess that once someone has signed your key once, and therefore
should trust that you are who you say you are, then, because they
trust your key, they'll not be reluctant to sign a reasonable new ID.

I  tried.  15  times.  Every  time  I  get the same response "No error".

Where did you get the archieve from ? I downloaded it from
www.gnupg.org a couple of days ago and it worked just fine. I can
email it to you privately if you want me to (it's about 1.9MB); just
tell me on my private mail.

It will in NT/2000, not on win9x since they don't have a stderr.

The message you are showing is not the same our clients had, but there does
appear to be a cipher preference problem for DSH/ELG key pairs generated by
1.0.6.  Once our clients went to the latest version of pgp 7, they were able
to use the keys.

You're message almost sounds like you sent them a public key that can only
sign but not encrypt.  However, that might be an artifact of the above issue
dealing with the cipher preferences.  I forget which one was causing
problems on the PGP side.

Well, this is odd.. I originally downloaded the file from 
www.gnupg.org, but now that I download it again today, all the files 
are indeed included.  Sorry for the false alarm.

Another reason for this might be that the key has been retrieved from
a keyserver and the keyserver removed the (encryption) subkeys due to
a bug.  I get quite often mails that it is not possible to send me an
encrypted mail due to a missing encryption subkey.  When the sender
retrieves the key by other means (e.g. X-Request-PGP: mail header) it
does work.

Message-ID: <E11AC8AB6A04D2119EB60060084FFD22B91396@NTSERVER>

Hi,

I've got this tip for making GPG easier to use in Windows.
To add encrypt/decrypt commands to the context menu (right click on a file):

Assuming gpg.exe is installed in c:\app\gnupg
and
the id of the key you'd like to use is ID
then with
regedit.exe
in the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell
(create the shell key if it is not there yet):

For encrypting create a key:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG encrypt and sign with <your email address
here>\command
	(Default) = "c:\App\gnupg\gpg -u ID --armor --sign --encrypt "%1""

put double qoutes around the %1 in case the file name has spaces.
If you have more keys, then add more entries

For decrypting create a key:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG decrypt and verify (to file.out)\command
	(Default) = "c:\App\gnupg\gpg -o "%1%.out" "%1""

Peter

Incredibly  powerful  and  sexy integration with the Windows GUI! Big up
for Peter (as Ali would have said it).

Simple  and  trivial perhaps, but insert an additional '&' preceding the
character  in  the  selection  title  you want to become hotkey for that
context menu selection. As follows:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG &encrypt and sign with some@com.com

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG &decrypt and verify (to file.out)

Even faster!

Thanks for your hints. A keyserver problem is not possible because I did not 
use a keyserver (I first wanted to try this with a test key without spreading 
it). 

I think I have an answer despite I don't really know whether I did something 
wrong. The ElGamal subkey is present (for encryption only) but there is also a 
DSA subkey. GPG has no problems with that subkey but I think PGP 6/7 (which 
I've tried) can't handle it because everything worked after I removed it. 

As I read in the OpenPGP-RFC it should be compliant to have such DSA subkey but 
it's no problem that I can't use it because I didn't want to do this later 
anyway. Only the top level key provides signature services so this should not 
be of any practical use to me - or is it?

Message-ID: <1D82815C322BD41196EA00508B951F7B021B3A09@MCHH265E>

Hi,
I want to have my secret keyring on my floppy drive. So I modified the 
OPTIONS file by adding the following line:

secret-keyring A:\secring.gpg

and moved my secring.gpg to A:\  .Now GPG does not find my secring
anymore. Instead it shows the following error message:

D:\PROGRA~2\WinPT>gpg --list-secret-keys

gpg: keyblock resource `D:/Program Files/WinPT//A:\secring.gpg': file open error

So it keeps the old location and appends the new one. How can I specify another drive?

Best regards

Yes.  PGP does not support signing subkeys.

There is a practical use - many people like to set expiration dates on
their subkeys and/or rotate them every now and then.  Using a signing
subkey this way means you don't have to generate a new key and get it
signed each time.

Using a signing subkey also means you can keep your primary key
offline and just use the subkeys for signing and encryption.

Hi !

This will sign "file" with your key.

> gpg -sa file
This will sign "file" and produce ASCII-armoured output

You should use
gpg -e file
gpg -ea file
to actually encrypt "file".

You can also do both:
gpg -es file
gpg -esa file

Then you can decrypt with:
gpg -d .....

If you do a "dir" on the commandline, you will see that gpg has
created a file called "text.txt.gpg" which is the encrypted one. The
original data (unencrypted) is still in "text.txt".

> C:\proj\files>gpg -d text.txt

You have to decrypt the encrypted file, obviously.
gpg -d text.txt.gpg
will work :-)

I've tried this tip on my NT system and it's work for me. I have another
question. Is it possible to support long file name?

By the way, how to specify more than one recipient name?

Thanks!

Regards,

Ching-che Chen

Hi,

I've got this tip for making GPG easier to use in Windows.
To add encrypt/decrypt commands to the context menu (right click on a file):

Assuming gpg.exe is installed in c:\app\gnupg
and
the id of the key you'd like to use is ID
then with
regedit.exe
in the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell
(create the shell key if it is not there yet):

For encrypting create a key:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG encrypt and sign with <your email address
here>\command
	(Default) = "c:\App\gnupg\gpg -u ID --armor --sign --encrypt "%1""

put double qoutes around the %1 in case the file name has spaces.
If you have more keys, then add more entries

For decrypting create a key:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG decrypt and verify (to file.out)\command
	(Default) = "c:\App\gnupg\gpg -o "%1%.out" "%1""

Well, the file name %1 is enclosed in double quotes, so if GPG supports
long file names (with spaces), then it should work fine. You can try it out
yourself.

Hi Peter,

I think I didn't describe my question about long file name clearly.

I tried to decrypt a file "filenameover8.txt.asc", the out put file
is "filena~1.asc.out". I just wondered is there some way to ensure
that GPG can get a long file name form correctly.

If this is a limitation, it's OK. Those tips already help me much and
convenience enough. Thanks!

As usual with a GNU software there are no limitations on filename
lengths. 

I recall that once you had to set a LONGNAMES flag in the created
executable to tell Windows (or was it just OS/2) not to autoconvert
the names.  However I am not sure on this, any windows hacker here?

I read just now the"CERT Advisory CA-2002-07 Double Free Bug in zlib Compression
Library" - CA-2002-07, http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-07.html.

The GnuPG uses the zlib library (release 1.1.3), and the
systems affected are "any  software  that  is  linked  to
zlib  1.1.3 or earlier", or "data  compression libraries derived from zlib 1.1.3 or
earlier may contain a similar bug".


The gpg is affected by this bug in zlib?
The zlib library inside the GnuPG package or in the CVS will be changed?

Note that, as you are running Linux, it is quite likely that your gpg is
dynamically linked against the zlib libraries you probably have
installed on your system. You can check this with, e.g.:
admcd@bifrons:~$ ldd $(which gpg)
        libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x40022000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x40031000)
        libnsl.so.1 => /lib/libnsl.so.1 (0x40035000)
        libgdbm.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgdbm.so.1 (0x4004a000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40050000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)

The libz is zlib. In this case you will want to upgrade the libz you
have installed and gpg will not need recompiling or relinking against
the updated version. Most of the main distributions have already
released updated zlib packages. Consult their security updates pages
for information.

        I'm pretty sure Werner is including zlib 1.1.4 into the next releas=

My main point:  He also asked to be shown if he's wrong.

Side note:  To (mis)quote the Romulan ambassador:  "Frankly, Chancellor, I
don't know *what* to believe."  My understanding is that the GPL isn't
intend to be "viral" in the sense he meant it, but since many people are
confused by that, and companies like Microsoft can twist the wording into
showing it's "wrong" and "un-american", maybe the wording in the GPL
should be revised somehow to make the true intention clear.  Obviously
this won't stop determined FUD spreading, but it should make it simpler
for anyone who takes a moment to actually read it.

And it's an FAQ:

echo PASSPHRASE | gpg --passphrase-fd=3D0 ......

Check the manual: Unix/Linux "man gpg", Windows "gpg.man" or something
similar.

Yep, same problem here (W2K).
I tried "%~f1" (see Start | Help, index %), but then gpg.exe fails.

Anyone?

I know about --passphrase-fd n,
but it is not usable under Win9x :(

Also I know about a secret key without the password (--edit passwd)
I read  man and forum :)



!!!!!!!!!!!!! I need ability to specify password in the command line !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: [Announce] GnuPG fix for included zlib
Message-ID: <871yemar0b.fsf@alberti.gnupg.de>

--=-=-=

Hi!

As you probably all know, a security problem with the compress library
zlib has been found which affects a lot of software.  For details see:

  http://www.zlib.org/advisory-2002-03-11.txt

and the security announcements for your OS.

GnuPG does also use zlib; however in most environments the system
provided zlib is used.  So an update to this system library is
sufficient to fix the problem in GnuPG.

On systems without a installed zlib, the GnuPG build process
automatically includes the zlib copy which come with it.  This may
also be forced by using the --with-included-zlib configure option.
On those systems, GnuPG needs to be updated!  A patch with
instructions is attached to this mail.

Note, that the MS-Windows version is also affected by this bug; an
updated binary package will be available soon.

  Werner

Hash: SHA1
NotDashEscaped: You need GnuPG to verify this message

This is a patch against gnupg 1.0.6 to fix the security bug in the
zlib code.  Please note that on most systems the zlib code which comes
with GnuPG is not used because usually the zlib provided by the system
is used.  This is in almost all cases a shared library, so it is
sufficient to upgrade this one.  If the system does only provide a
static library, you have to build GnuPG again.

Apply this patch if your system does not provide a usable zlib or you
configured GnuPG using the option --with-included-zlib.

The patch file is GnuPG signed; you might want to check the signature
after visual inspection that the patch file itself is not a
compressed one (which might trigger the bug).

 gpg --verify gnupg-zlib.patch

Change to the source directory (cd gnupg-1.0.6) and enter:

 patch -p2 <gnupg-zlib.patch

Then do a make and make install as usual.

Hi,

Recently I started using GnuPG 1.0.6 under W2K, together with 
GPGShell for Win v. 2.25.

Neither on the command line nor in GPGShell can I see any 
difference between a locally signed key and a key bearing an 
exportable signature. I know which are which but I don't want to 
remember it, I would like to be able to see which is what. 

Now the only difference I can find is when the key is exported, but
I would like to see it while the keys are on my pubring, either in 
GPG and/or in GPGShell. 

I would appreciate any advice.

Best regards,
=Dick Gevers=

Hi,

Recently I started using GnuPG 1.0.6 under W2K, together with 
GPGShell for Win v. 2.25.

Neither on the command line, nor in GPGShell can I generate RSA 
keys or use other non-default algorithms, ciphers or hashes. I 
looked through all the FAQ's, help files, man pages and Handbooks 
that I could find and tried every possible combination of the 
options
- --load-extension
- --rfc1991 
- --cipher-algo
- --compress-algo
(either direct or via the options files of GPG and GPGShell),
but in all cases the options presented are the same as those with 
"gpg --gen-key" without options.

I have idea.dll, sha2.dll and tiger.dll sitting in the same folder 
as GPG.exe (being G:/GPG), but it makes no difference. 

I have been able to work through the basic learning curve, I 
believe, of using GPG on the command line and via GPGShell, but I 
don't understand why these options won't work. Any help would be 
appreciated.

Thanks and regards,

Subject: fatal corruption with PGPKeys and GPG keyrings
Message-ID: <200203151632.g2FGWF1S004371@jupiter.accesscable.net>

I have PGP 7.0.3 for Win2k and have PGPKeys.

I also have PGP command line 6.5.8 for Win2k.

I have GnuPG 1.0.6 for Win2k and generally use it to generate new
keys, etc. but I have some legacy keys from PGP.

I have been trying to use the same keyrings for all three programs.

Everything interoperates pretty well, EXCEPT, if I use PGPKeys to
remove signatures from a key in my keyring, GnuPG immediately reports
this the next time I try to use the keyring:

C:\GnuPG>gpg --list-keys
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks(read) failed: invalid keyring

PGP (command line and PGPKeys) both continue to read and work with
the keyrings perfectly. The only way I have found to do *anything*
with the keyrings at this point is to copy my GnuPG backups over the
PGP-"corrupted" versions.

I have not tested whether similar operations with PGP command line
would cause the corruption.

Does GnuPG not support what I'm trying to do (remove signatures)? Is
this a bug with PGPKeys or PGP for Windows? Is this a bug with GnuPG?
Has anyone ever seen this (sorry, no search function for this mail
list that I can find)? Can anyone reproduce this?

Message-ID: <003101c1cc59$e67f69b0$6900a8c0@p1038mobile>

Hi all,

this has maybe already been discussed here, but I haven't seen any mention
of it on www.gnupg.org.

A colleague of mine pointed out to me that there is a security vulnerability
with zlib version < 1.1.4.
GnuPG 1.0.6 uses zlib version 1.1.3, so there is a security risk.

See
http://www.gzip.org/zlib/advisory-2002-03-11.txt


They suggested replacing older versions of zlib with zlib version 1.1.4,
I would suggest a new version of GnuPG that comes with zlib v 1.1.4.

GnuPG 1.0.7 shows a "L" between the "sig" and the keyid for local
signatures.  I don't know about GPGShell.

GnuPG 1.0.7 is getting closer to release.

GnuPG 1.0.6 cannot generate RSA keys.  That is a new feature in 1.0.7.

Please run 
 
  gpg --list-packets yourkeyring.pkr

It should bail out at the same packet but you get a listing of all
packets and by comparing it to a listing of an uncorrupted keyring you
should be able to figure out.  It might also be worth to use the
option "--debug 1"

It does.  However sharing the keyring won't anymore work with
forthcoming GnuPH versions.

Does GnuPG actually include zlib itself, or does it just require you have
zlib on your system, and then utilize that?

I just downloaded and compiled zlib 1.1.4 along with GnuPG yesterday,
assuming GnuPG would use the updated zlib... was I mistaken?

The source code includes a copy of zlib, but the build process uses
the system zlib if available.

I happen to compile GnuPG under Windows (using Cygwin) where
I don't have a system zlib, so it uses the one that comes with gnupg.
The latest version of gnupg, 1.0.6, comes with zlib version 1.1.3
(which has the vulnerability).  So I replaced the zlib library with
zlib version 1.1.4 and recompiled my gnupg.

Subject: Question about mangling of passphrases
Message-ID: <16775.1016236823@www42.gmx.net>

Hello GnuPG Users!

I wonder if it is safe to use GnuPG for symmetric encryption with 256 Bit
cyphers.
The problem I see is as follows: 

    When someone uses symmetric only encryption GnuPG prompts for a
passphrase.
    This passphrase is then hashed with an algorithm like RIPE-MD160 (whis
is the default)
    into a 160 Bit hash value.
    This 160 Bit hash value (or part of it) is then used as a key for a
symmetric cypher
    like BLOWFISH (whis has a key length of 128 Bit, so I assume the least
significant
    128 Bits of the hash value are being used).
    But what happens if someone uses a cypher with a key length of more than
160 Bit
    (e.g. 256 Bit) ?
    The hash value is too small to be used as the key for those cyphers.
    So how does GnuPG mangle the passphrase to yield a key with e.g. 256 Bit
?

Does anyone have an answer to that ?

I'm assuming you're taling about a GUI front end for GPG.

I used tkpgp for a while, but it was not worth the trouble. I generally use 
GPG for email. I run pine and used it display/send filter functions to pipe 
the text through GPG. It sounds harder than it is. The bottom line is that 
after setting it up, Pine calls GPG automatically to handle in incoming 
signed and/or encrypted messages and I get an offer to sign or sign/encrypt 
each outgoing message. It just doesn't get much easier.

If you use KMail or Evolution, GPG support is included.

If you need to process files, the command line is simple:

  gpg --encrypt filename --recipient [userid substring OR keyid]
  gpg --sign filename
  gpg --clearsign textfile
  gpg --decrypt filename (automatically checks signature too)
  gpg --verify filename (automatically retrieves key if necessary)

I spent some time looking for GUI front ends, but the commands are simple 
enough that I eventually concluded that it was a waste of time to spend 
hours fooling around with GUIs.

What happens is there are multiple hashes done so there will always be
enough bits of hash to fill in the key bits.  Each additional hash
beyond the first is preloaded with an increasing number of zeroes to
force the resulting hash to be different.

This is documented in RFC-2440, if you want to read more about it.
Look for the "String-to-key (S2K) specifiers" section.

The latest version of PGP that has been released for Linux is PGP 
6.5.8, and then only for the commandline.  GPG is also a commandline 
program.  In fact, there is nothing in Linux approaching the 
flexibility and functions of PGP with the GUI (nor may I add, I've not 
come across anything even approaching GPGShell [a Windows front end for 
GPG] in Linux).

The reason for this is mainly the key management functions, which are 
(sadly) missing from most front ends in Linux, and the ability to 
encrypt/sign/decrypt/verify text in a window having the focus.

The nearest thing that there is to it is to use an emailer like Kmail, 
Evolution, or Xfmail with built in support for PGP and GPG, but of 
course these will only deal with encryption/ signing/ decryption/ 
verification, not with key management.  There are some front ends that 
will enable you to keep your keyrings up to date, Seahorse and 
Geheimnis amongst them and they are useful to have about, but not 
all-embracing.....

I've come across a problem I'm not really sure how to fix.  It may not
be a gpg problem per se, but a problem with the PGP servers.

To make a long story short, I have two different versions of my pgp
key -- each with a different valid encryption subkey.  The old key is
no good, and no one can get the new key, because the pgp servers seem
to have problems with the key.  Now, the longer version:

Today, I updated my key by creating a new 4K Elgamal encryption key,
and revoking my old encryption subkey.  I also had a number of UIDs
that are no longer valid, so I revoked the signature on those.

Note that I'm pretty sure the 4K size of the key is not the problem,
as I created another key of 4K today, which I had no trouble with.

I uploaded the new version of my key to the keyserver at pgp.mit.edu,
and checked that the new key was reflected in querries.  Well, it had
completely disappeared!  Ok, not completely.  If I searched on my
name, the key doesn't show up.  If I search by key ID, it does show
up.

On my system, the key seems fine:

[note the "no secret key" message for my old subkey]

If I then, from another account that does not have my gpg keyring in
it run 

  $ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 0x81CFE75D

I get the following messages from gpg:

  $ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 81CFE75D
  gpg: requesting key 81CFE75D from pgp.mit.edu ...
  gpg: key 81CFE75D: invalid subkey binding
  gpg: key 81CFE75D: public key imported
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:               imported: 1

I'm suspecting this may be caused by the missing secret subkey for key
id 0x22E368D9.  I have a back up copy of the old key, which looks like
this:

  $ gpg --edit-key ddm
  Secret key is available.
  
  pub  1024D/81CFE75D  created: 2000-10-29 expires: never      trust: -/u
  sub  1024g/22E368D9  created: 2000-10-29 expires: never     
  (1)  Derek Martin <ddm@pizzashack.org>
  (2)  Derek Martin <ddm@cerberus.ne.mediaone.net>
  (3). Derek Martin <ddm@mclinux.com>

I've tried numerous combinations of exporting and importing the secret
keys and public keys, and while I can import the public side of the
old encryption key, I can not import the corresponding secret key:

  $ ssh otherhost gpg --export-secret-keys -a |gpg --import --allow-secret
  ddm@otherhost's password: 
  gpg: key 81CFE75D: already in secret keyring
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:       secret keys read: 1
  gpg:  secret keys unchanged: 1

I think this may be a bug; gpg seems to be failing to detect that
there's a new secret subkey in the exported key, and isn't importing
it.  During one of my iterations, I removed the old encryption key and
the revoked UIDs, and I was then able to --recv-key the key after
uploading it to the server.  However, at that point, the key stopped
showing up in searches on my name (it does still show up in searches
on the key id).  I did some more goofing around, and the key is
showing up in searches again, but now it can't be imported (the public
encryption subkey won't import).

So, basically, it seems like I have two different useless keys.
Obviously I don't want to create a whole new key, as a) it's a pain to
generate long keys, b) I'll have to get people to sign my key all over
again, c) I already have a couple of old keys I can't access out
there.  So I'd really, really, really like to recover this key to make
it usable.

AAAAGGGGGGHHHH!

While I'm waiting for the gurus to soothsay me an answer, I'm going to
hit the Bailey's.  Happy St. Patricks Day!  =8^)

Except mine's slightly worse, because the key server evidently has a
bogus version of my key, so no one can get my new encryption subkey.

Hey Douglas, ever get your situation straightened out?

Geheimnis refuses to compile here!  IT IS DRIVING ME INSANE!  ./configure
refuses to use whatever default C++ compiler Slackware comes with.  I think
it comes with g++... but could be mistaken.  Either way, it refuses to use
it.

I'm currently *trying* to work with GPA.  Not having much luck.  I really
really really want to import my entire keyring from PGP to GPG, but am
thinking that isn't possible.  If I can't do that, I would at least like to
be able to import my private keys... but heck, I can't even do that.

Nevermind, just got that working (manually, from the command line, importing
private keys)... things are looking up a bit.

I love this stuff!  :-)

Hello.
 I recently posted a question about bernsteins facorting work. Schneier
talks about the paper in the latest cryptogram. It is a little off topic
for the list but still interesting...

go to counterpane.com for latest cryptogram (i am too lazy to link)

--BEGIN CRYPTO-GRAM
Bernstein's Factoring Breakthrough?



Last fall, mathematician Dan Bernstein circulated a paper discussing
improvements in integer factorization, using specialized parallel
hardware.  The paper didn't get much attention until recently, when
discussions sprang up on SlashDot and other Internet forums about the
results.  A naive read of the paper implies that factoring is now
significantly easier using the machine described in the paper, and that
keys as long as 2048 bits can now be broken.

This is not the case.  The improvements described in Bernstein's paper
are unlikely to produce the claimed speed improvements for practically
useful numbers.

Currently the fastest factoring algorithm is the Number Field Sieve
(NFS), which supplanted the Quadratic Sieve several years ago.=20
Basically, the NFS has two phases.  The first is a search for equations
that satisfy certain mathematical properties.  This step is highly
parallelizable, and today is routinely done with thousands of
computers.  The second step is a large matrix calculation, which
eventually produces the prime factors of the target number.

Bernstein attempts to improve the efficiency of both steps.  There are
some good observations here that will result in some minor speedups in
factoring, but the enormous improvements claimed are more a result of
redefining efficiency than anything else.  Bernstein positions his
results as an effect of massive parallization.  To me, this is
misleading.  You can always simulate a parallel machine on a single
computer by using a time-sliced architecture.  In his model, the "cost"
of factoring is a product of time and space, and he claims that he can
reduce the cost of parallel sorting from a factor of m^4 to m^3.=20
Bernstein justifies his assumptions by claiming that a single processor
needs m^2 memory, whereas an array of m^2 processors only needs constant
memory.  This may be true, but neglects to factor in the cost associated
with connecting those processors: tying a million simple processors
together is much more expensive than using a single processor of the
same design with a mi
llion bits of memory.  Again, it is not clear that this technique will
buy you anything for practical sized numbers.

To be sure, Bernstein does not say anything different.  (In fact, I
commend him for not being part of the hyperbole.)  His result is
asymptotic.  This means that it is eventually true, as the size of the
number factored approaches infinity.  This says nothing about how much
more efficient Bernstein's algorithm is, or even whether or not it is
more efficient than current techniques.  Bernstein himself says this in
one of his posts:  "Protecting against [these techniques] means
switching from n-bit keys to f(n)-bit keys.  I'd like to emphasize that,
at this point, very little is known about the function f.  It's clear
that f(n) is approximately (3.009...)n for *very* large sizes n, but I
don't know whether f(n) is larger than n for *useful* sizes n."  What he
means is: at some bit length these techniques will be useful, but we
have no idea what that bit length is.

I don't believe in the factor of n - 3n length improvement.  Any
practical implementation of these techniques depends heavily on
complicated technological assumptions and tradeoffs.  Parallel computing
is much easier to say than it is to do, and there are always hidden
complexities.  I think when all the math is said and done, these other
complexities will even out his enhancements.

This is not to belittle Bernstein's work.  This is good research.  I
like his novel way of using sorting techniques to carry out the linear
algebra part.  This might be useful in a variety of other contexts, and
is likely to open up new research directions in the design of more
efficient sorting networks and sparse matrix algorithms.  There are
other speed improvements to the NFS in this paper, and they will most
definitely be researched further.

Over the past several decades factoring has steadily gotten easier, and
it's gotten easier faster than anyone would have believed.  Speed
improvements have come from four sources.  One, processors have gotten
faster.  Two, processors have gotten cheaper and easier to network in
parallel computations.  Three, there have been steady flows of minor
improvements to the factoring algorithms.  And four, there have been
fundamental advances in the mathematics of factoring.

I believe that Bernstein's work falls under the third category, and
takes advantage of ancillary improvements in the second category.  And
if history is any guide, it will be years before anyone knows exactly
whether, and how, this work will affect the actual factoring of
practical numbers.

[SNIP]

Ok thanks, but well, my problem is a bit more involved than just
that.  Basically the problem is that on the machine that I read mail,
I accidentally deleted my old encryption subkey.  I still have other
subkeys on that keyring associated with my signing key (0x81CFE75D)
that I need to keep.  But obviously, I want to keep my old encryption
key around, so I can decrypt messages that are sent to me by people
who haven't yet gotten the new subkey from me, or forgot to import it,
or for messages I already have hanging around...

I have a copy of the old subkey on another machine.  That old keyring
does not have the other subkeys that I wish to keep.  What I need to
do is merge the two keyrings.

I can do this with the PUBLIC subkeys no problem.  However, GPG will
not let me incorporate the SECRET subkey, no matter what I try.  I've
tried using both --export-secret-key and --export-secret-subkey on the
export side of things, and I always use --allow-secret on the import
side, but I only get error messages from gpg as such:

  $ ssh otherhost gpg -a --export-secret-subkey ddm |gpg --allow-secret --import
  ddm@otherhost's password: 
  gpg: key 81CFE75D: already in secret keyring
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:       secret keys read: 1
  gpg:  secret keys unchanged: 1

So, gpg seems to fail to realize that there are subkeys in the
exported block that are not in the local copy, and refuses to import
them.  Whether or not this is intended behavior, I think this is a
bug.  Otherwise, there's no way to recover accidentally deleted
subkeys, and if you DO accidentally delete a subkey, your options
would be to maintain two different keyrings (one with the deleted one
and the other with all the other keys), or throw up your hands in
frustration and generate a whole new key.  And if you have old
messages that you still need to decrypt with the old key, the latter
isn't even really an option. Neither of those options is ideal.  IMO,
the best solution is for gpg to allow the import of secret subkeys.

Please note: I'm not on gnupg-devel, so please CC me ONLY if your
reply is going to be ONLY on that list (I'm on gnupg-users).  

Thanks.

I compile GnuPG Unices releases (SCO OpenServer, UnixWare, Solaris x86 etc etc),
and I compile these packages statically linked with the zlib available
inside the gpg sources.

This is the problem for me.

The guess you were writing that e-mail on Linux was from the pine
message ID which was of the form: <Pine.LNX.etc@etc>

Werner sent an e-mail to gnupg-announce (Bcc'ed I think to gnupg-devel)
on 2002-03-15 supplying a patch. I can find it in the gnupg-devel
archives, but not gnupg-announce as yet. See:

Hello Users;

Has the Windows download at the "gnupg" web - site been recompiled with
the new library.  If not is there a expected release date.  Also will
this be reflected in a different version number.

Subject: Problem with --not-dash-escaped
Message-ID: <17261.1016325475@www52.gmx.net>

Hello All!

Is there a problem with 'gpg --not-dash-escaped --clearsign ...' under
Windows ?

When I sign a message with the above command I don't get any error
messages. But when I check the signature afterwards with
'gpg --verify ...' I always get the message : Invalid signature.

I use GnuPG 1.0.6 under Windows 98. (The binary distribution from
http://www.gnupg.org/download.html).

Can anyone help ?

P.S: I didn't send the signed message via email and it didn't contain
       5 dashes at the beginning of a line, so that is not the problem

O.K. Thanks David!

Could this process be used to "emulate" a stronger Hash algorithm
(one with a hash value with more than 160 bit) ?

Let me explain this:

In the GnuPG FAQ section 4.1 one can read the following:

"1024 bit for DSA signatures; even for plain ElGamal signatures this is
sufficient as the size of the hash is probably the weakest link if the key size
is larger than 1024 bits."

So If this process could be used to "emulate" a hash with a greater size it
would not
be anymore the weakest link and it would make sense to use DSA keys with
more than
1024 bit.

I guess this is nonsense but could you please tell why the above process of
taking
multiple hashes to fill in a symmetric key is safe and why it is not safe to
use the
same process to generate a hash with a greater size so that it would make
sense
to use greater key sizes for DSA ?

actually you may be wrong:
Cygwin have zlib - cygz.dll
and GPG compiled with Cygwin uses it (I just checked with depends.exe)

so you need newer cygz.dll.
(unless you compile GPG with --with-included-zlib switch)

I believe that the gnupg-w32-1.0.6-2.zip on ftp.gnupg.org is the

Hello Users;

The new release for windows seems to have cleared up a problem I had
with automatically retreiving keys when I derypt / verify e-mail.  I
was usein "106", with "WinPT" and W2k.

I have just retreveived two keys with out any errors from "WinPT".
I suppose a longer period of time wil tell for sure.  But before it
never happened.

Yes! I work at a Gnu/Linux box. But, I maintain a web site called "GnuPG
for Unix" (http://gnupg.unixsecurity.com.br). This site make
available many gpg Unices packages...

Can you post a short sample signature that did not work?  Also, sort
of key are you signing with?

hi all

i have a funny problem: when my unix username matches one of the keys
in the public keyring, which is not the key for which i have a private
key, i seem to have problems with the trust path. it's as if gpg
always thinks that that key is the owner's key and barks everytime i
need to encrypt, e.g.

my username is "blais".
when i create a db with a secret key for user your_name, e.g.

,----
| tadora:~$ gpg --list-keys
| /home/blais/.gnupg/pubring.gpg

i tried fiddling with more signing, and setting the trust, to no

did not have the warning.

so i tried setting the --local-user, the --default-key and fiddling
with all the other options and the options file, and i cannot seem to
get rid of that warning.

any idea?
please Cc, i'm not on this list.

All,

how can it be that there is a gpa-0.5 archive donwloadable from the
gnupp pages but nothing available from the gpa homepage or gpa CVS
repository ???

Is 0.5 just the same as 0.4.3?  Or are there any 'political' reasons
to keep development closed nowadays?  Anything else?  I don't know
what's going on, but it would be nice if someone could shed light on
this.  (Yes, I looked at the ml archives, nothing relevant found.)

Please cc me as I am not on these lists.

Jochen

Not really:

The source code is under the GNU GPL and publicly available for
free. That's not exactly what I'd call "closed development".

> Anything else?

There was a deadline to meet. Keeping the CVS in sync and
discussing everything on this list would have meant to miss it.
So I just went on my way and produced gpa-0.5.0.tar.gz in time.

If you are willing to spend two months or so improving GPA, be
welcome to do it your way.

Currently I do not have the time to sync the new source with the
CVS - sorry for that. (For example, I would have to write a *long*
ChangeLog, and to hack my changes to the Makefiles into the various
autofoo input files - and I am not familiar with those autofoo
utilities.)

If you are willing to help merging back both versions of GPA, be
welcome!

Well, there wasn't much to interfere with from the outside during that
process.  But anyway, you did the work, you decide.

I am not claiming that I would have spent time, 'cause I haven't
looked at gpa for a while (since nothing was going on and moreover I
just didn't use it so far.  Last time I checked it was still kind of
unuseable.  And then I work mostly on the commandline or in emacs
anyway.)

The question here is whether it was necessary to let get cvs out of
sync from the start.  At least there would have been the possibility
to create a new branch for your stuff -- without getting into too many
discussions -- that could be merged back.  And ChangeLog?  Are you
suggesting there is no documentation about what you did at all?  If it
isn't needed, why bother writing it now:(  Otherwise, just put it in
there, it might be terse, but that's better than nothing.

One possible strength of OpenSource software is the peer-review
process that you effectively circumvented before coming up with the
0.5.0 version of gpa that now is widely spread into userland, towards
people that are not supposed to be beta-testers.
Maybe you did everything right and the program is just flawless
without any external testing, but that is not what you normally can
count on.

It just looks very strange that nothing is going on with the sources
of a open project and all the sudden there is a new version.  Kind of
the first major version (considering it's announcements).  Somehow
like they told you one year ago we need it on Mar 10, 2002, and Mar 1
you actually realize that's only nine more days...

I am grateful to all you guys building gnupg and it's environment,
because that stuff is really important, but I am seriously puzzled
about what happened here?

Jochen

It is usable now.

Perfect. Then you will have no problem with GPA 0.5.0:
If you don't like it, don't use it.

You seem to know exactly what has to be done. Please do it then.

If you don't like the way how GPA 0.5.0 was created, be welcome to
do it better. You have the full source code of both GPA 0.5.0 and
0.4.3, and the GNU GPL grants you full permission to use it.

This is not a drink-or-die situation as with proprietary software.
You have the freedom.

BTW, as far as GPA is concerned, *we* gave this freedom to you.

Have you run the "configure" script before calling "make" ? Does
"configure" report any errors ?

On my linux machine, I would type:
configure
make
make-install (as root) to install it on the system

If you have run "configure" before "make", what kind of errors do you
get ?

Armin

Fellow GPG Enthusiasts,

I have written a simple menu driven interface to GPG
that I find easier to use than memorizing the command
line. You may find it useful too. It is at
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/GnuPG/gpg-dialog.pl. 

This script is written in generic Perl and should run
on both the Unix and Win32 platforms. The script is
essentially self documenting.

Do use it and give me your feedback at this email
address.

Hi Christina!

You can download a precompiled GnuPG package (1.0.6) for Sun machines
(ix86 or Sparc) at this site:

http://gnupg.unixsecurity.com.br

Okay?

GnuPG does not currently allow importing secret subkeys.  In your
particular example where you have two different copies of the secret
key, each with a different subkey, you are going to have a
difficulties.  It's not exactly a common problem. :)

The solution is to generate one key from your two, and import that.
To do this, you need the "gpgsplit" tool, which is part of GnuPG 1.0.7
(grab the test version from
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/devel/gnupg-1.0.6d.tar.gz if you need it).
Run one of the keys through gpgsplit and delete all the files that
come before the first "XXXXXXX-007.secret_subkey" file.

Then cat the key you didn't split along with the files that are left
after you deleted everything before the secret subkey.

For example:

$ gpgsplit mykey2
$ rm 000001-005.secret_key 000002-013.user_id 000003-002.sig
$ cat mykey1 000004-007.secret_subkey 000005-002.sig > mywholekey
$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import mywholekey

Hello,
 Are there any reasons why I would not want to run 1.0.6d? My pubring
file has gotten quite large but I like having a lot of keys on disk. It
seems that gpg slows down quite a bit doing trust calculations with this
large keyring. If I remember correctly 1.0.7 is scheduled to be quicker
on trust calculations. Does 6d have the same speedups? And what do
others do with large keyrings to make things go quicker? And finalyy
what are the 1.1.x versions in the devel directory? Are there any great
new features being worked on in 1.1?

GnuPG 1.0.6d is (or rather, will be) 1.0.7, it just needs some more
work and testing.

Several people (including me) are running 1.0.6d quite happily.
Still, it is a development version.  There is a reason it prints a
warning on startup: "NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!  It is only
intended for test purposes and should NOT be used in a production
environment or with production keys!"

If you do choose to give 1.0.6d a try, be sure to report any problems
back to gnupg-devel so they can be fixed.

The 1.1.x versions in the devel directory are actually older in terms
of code than 1.0.7. :)

I am signing with a 1024 Bit DSA key, but I can reproduce the error with
all keys.
The error only happens under Windows and only if the last line of the
message I am signing is not empty (i.e. the message does not end with
CR - LF).
When I sign a message that does not end with CR - LF GnuPG adds a
CR - LF pair.
That triggers the bug. When I delete the CR (and not the LF) which was
added by GnuPG the signature becomes valid !
So that seems to be the problem.

Subject: gnupg to encrypt files in a batch processes
Message-ID: <3C97D352.85193C07@sesame.com>

I am new to encryption & gnupg, so please bear with me.  This is my
first posting.

Has anyone used gnupg to encrypt files in a batch processes??
I have a java program which reads files from a mailbox directory, parses

the file for sender, recipient, subject & message, and then sends the
email.   I am modifying this program to optionally sign and/or encrypt
the message portion of the email.  Currently it runs a gpg command on
the command line and reads the resulting stream from standard out.  (I
got this working on Windows 2000 without being prompted for a
passphrase, but when I began testing in Linux this was not the case.)

My problem was that I was being prompted for a passphrase for each email
receipt.
Is the solution to use the --passphrase-fd option??  Where can I find
documentation on this?

gpg -s -e -o - --batch --yes --passphrase-fd n -r myemail@mycompany.com
/usr/local/BatchMail/mailbox/TestFileMsg

where TestFileMsg is the message portion of the email to be sent to
myemail@mycompany.com,  and n is the file descriptor.  What is n
exactly?  What is the format of this file?

Is this the right approach?

Also, I would prefer to use gpgme for this since it is unrestricted by
its back-end.   What are the gpgme commands for this??

Thanks,
Tom

This would be your command

echo PASSPHRASE | gpg -s -e -o - --batch --yes --passphrase-fd 0 -r
myemail@mycompany.com /usr/local/BatchMail/mailbox/TestFileMsg

"0" means stdin stream.

That's unsecure:  If "echo" is an external program, then
everybody having shell access to the machine can spy out the
PASSPHRASE using the "ps" program.

I recommend to do it like this:

put the PASSPHRASE into a file, for example
/usr/local/BatchMail/passphrase, and then use the command

gpg -s -e -o - --batch --yes --passphrase-fd 0 -r myemail@mycompany.com /us=
r/local/BatchMail/mailbox/TestFileMsg < /usr/local/BatchMail/passphrase

This person lost their passphrase to their old secret key.  So we are
suggesting that a work around to telling the world that it's lost is for him
to sign it with his new key, then revoke the signature and upload the old
key to the keyserver again.

Guess it's time for the experts to step in and set us onto the right path.

     Probably didn't need to do this but at least your old key is now signed
by your new key.

I've never revoked just the signature before.  But, the process should be
similar to revoking the entire key.  It should write out a certificate that
you can import back in to the keyring.

Guess we need the experts from the gnupg-users email list.  I'll cc that
list on this reply and suggest that you look there for further assistance.

>When I look at the key server now there's nothing there that tells me that
anything has changed.. 

Somehow you need to get that signature revoke certificate generated and
imported back in to the keyring.  Then upload the results to the keyserver.

Should I copy my old public >key to Linux, sign/revsign it, then move the
signed/revoked public key back over to WinPT, and
>send the signed/revoked public key up with WinPT?

In theory you should be able to pull a key down from the keyserver, sign it,
upload it back.  All you need to do is add in the revoke signature piece
before uploading it again.

Just import the revoke certificate.

Hi!

The subject should give all information which are useful. I had
some problems to extract some keys of a very large key file but
I didn't find any tool for this. So I decided to start a little
project for this. The result is gpgext which should run on Linux

I don't know if other people have the same problem, but if the

The textbooks (e.g. William Stalling's Cryptography & Network Security, 2nded, page 359) refer to PGP using one-time session keys to encrypt messages.

GnuPG seems to use subkeys to encrypt messages instead (see GNU Privacy
Handbook, page 23).

Is this a difference between PGP and GnuPG, or due to using ElGamal instead
of RSA, or what ?

First I downloaded the key from the keyserver with:

        gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0xE60F7299



I did this with the following:

        gpg --edit-key 0xE60F7299

and the "sign" command.

If you mean write out a new _file_, no, it did not write out a new file. Perhaps this is where I went wrong.
Should I try this on a file containing the old public key instead of on a key downloaded from the keyserver?

This is gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6 BTW

Ok, well this is what I obviously don't know how to do corectly. GnuPG users: how do I do this?

How to do that is currently beyond me :-/

But I don't have one :-) that's the whole problem. There is no separate revoke cert that I can see.

GnuPG users _ is there a way I can make a revoke certificate as a file, that I can import back into WinPT?

Thanks.

It is no difference at all. All OpenPGP apps use one-time session keys.

It is that rfc2440-compliant ones use other public keys (public subkeys)
to encrypt them. It is difference in PK management, not in session protocol.

Both :)

The private keyring stores private keys (presumably your own).  The
public keyring stores your own and other peoples' public keys.

However - each private key also contains a copy of its corresponding
public key.  If you ever lose all copies of your public key
(unlikely), you could regenerate it (minus signatures from other
people) from the private key.

GnuPG follows your second description.  The 'keyrings' are inseparate
files, secring.gpg and pubring.gpg.

The concept of 'keyrings' is really an implementation issue, separate from
any specification.  An implementation could put all the keys in one
'keyring' (file/table/etc).

In common lingo a "my X keyring" is often used to mean "all the X keys I
have available to me".

[...]

Not at all. The session key is needed for encrypting the message using
one of the symmetric algorithms (CAST, 3DES, Rijndael or whatever...).
This key should _not_ be used again (this is what good cryptographers
teach).

RSA or any other asymmetric algorithm is used to encrypt the session
key with the public key of the recipient.

The private keyring only stores private keys. The public keyring stores all 
public keys no matter who owns them.

Applications that treat the owner's public key differently simply have to 
look at both keyrings to find matching (complementary) keys.

presently, we are using pgp encryption software form Network Associates. 
Regarding to a possible migration to another encryption-software, I have

The most important one:
What are the terms and conditions to use gnupg in business matters? Which is

Thank you in advance for your help.

You may sue the program as you like. The source code is avaliable, and the
only limitation is that in case of providing _modified_ gnupg to anyone
outside the organization, like, customers, the changes and modifications
must be distributed on the same license as the orginal program, that is, The
GNU General Public License version 2 or later.=20

I think a good way would be to contract Werner's compant G10Code Gmbh.

yes, but since vanilla GPG code is avaliable, the more important aspect is
the modified code. Notabene AFAIK (IANAL) you can charge for both modified

This is a regression test and it does not make any sense to use it for
your own things.  run  "make check" to see if your build does work.

Hi ALL:

I downloaded the gpgme release 0.3.4. In the configure options, we
can compile it with the GpgSM module 0.3.1 support. The point is: where
can I found this =C4gypten module? The "ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/aegypten=
"
directory there are many packages, but what's the GpgSM module package?

thanks

Hello folks,
My apologies if this question has been asked before. I have created a
encrypted file encrypted with two different recipients. How do I decrypt
this file using the other user? The -u option does not seem to work. I
am running 1.0.6 gpg. 
%gpg -u <UID> --decrypt myTest1.gpg
It keeps asking for my pass phrase and not that of the "test" user pass
phrase.
Can some one tell me what option I should be using?
Thanks in advance.

Subject: Secret splitting w/ threshold
Message-ID: <22FD1855C2B16C40A1F6DE406420021E0187F8C7@mail.bai.org>

I was about to implement a custom secret-splitting threshold scheme for our
corporate officers, using Shamir's polynomial method and a simple
spreadsheet to do the math.

Then I considered doing a simple geometirc scheme, giving each officer the
equation of a line and letting the secret be the intersection of two or more
of these in cartesian space. This scheme would be simpler for the execs to
reconstruct in an emergency without technical help. In fact, the whole
reconstruction process could be described on the back of the laminated
"secret card" I'm going to give them.

As I understand it, both of these schemes are equally secure, presuming
large enough numbers are used as coefficients. Can anybody offer a reason
why I shouldn't choose the easier geometic scheme?

Also, it occurs to me that there is probably a good open-source program that
implement this sort of thing, although my Googleing bore no such fruit. Does
anyone have a good link to a simple, secure secret-sharing program?

Finally, the secret-sharing built into the commercial PGP, while pretty
neat, was only useful for PGP key material. I wish to share 10-20 bytes of
passphrase material. What secret sharing capabilites are coming in GnuPG?
Will it be able to share any secret?

There is no command line option to handle this case, as generally
people don't encrypt to themselves multiple times.

That said, you can still do it - just hit "enter" three times when
prompted for the passphrase for the key you don't want to use.  This
will make GnuPG roll over and try the next available key.

Good job on "Rhapsody in Blue", by the way ;)

If I understand your problem, this is a suggested solution when you have a
file encrypted for multiple recipient. I don't know if this is a bug or
not but when decrypting, gpg ALWAYS use the first user in the secring.gpg
file even if you specify the user with -u option.

%gpg --export-secret-keys <UID> > gpgtemp.asc
%gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring gpgtemp.asc --decrypt
myTest1.gpg

I hope this helps you.

OpenPGP does not define any key splitting algorithm.  I have some
doubts whether this can be accomplised at all using the OpenPGP
protocol.  The hard thing with key splitting is to get the usability
right.  What PGP provides is not sufficient because (afaik) all parts
most be combined on the same machine this does not increase the
security unless that machine is physical secure and provides a clean
protocol to combine the keys.

If your goal is that 2 persons have to sign a document to get a valid
signature, you should setup an organisation policy to enforce this and
use 2 simple signatures.  It is definitely possible to add some policy
enforcement rules to GnuPG.

It is the newpg-x.y.z.tar.gz.  The rationale behind this name is that
eventually it will be merged back into GnuPG.  If you look at the
source you will see "This file is part of GnuPG".

Ah yes, you need libksba and libgcrypt as well. See
http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/development.en.html 

gpgme works fine without gpgsm.

If you wish to avoid the file, I would suggest something along:

$ cat << EOF | gpg --passphrase-fd-0 [...]
ThisIsTheSecretPassphrase
EOF

this way, the pipe would probably(?) never make it to disk.

If you really want to create your own scheme, you should use
successive encryption using one time pads (giving each officer (except
one) an OTP, and one officer gets the encrypted private key).

Your approach based on simple linear algebra might interact badly with
the actual cryptography.

Thanks for responding. I tried your solution but I am afraid I get an
error:

gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 0C18F568, created 2002-03-22

gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
[
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=36)
or
gpg: decrypt_message failed: unexpected data

The command that I used was:

%gpg --output myTest.gpg --encrypt -r rasoul -r test1 myTest.txt
%gpg --export-secret-keys [test1 || uid] > gpgtemp.asc
%gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring gpgtemp.asc --decrypt
myTest.gpg

Can you tell me what is going on?

thanks in advance

I'm sorry, but bash use temporary files to implement here documents
(like any other shell, I think).

Hello Group,

I had two questions about gpg-dialog.

First,  Can it be compiled into a W32 exe file.  If so can someone tell
me how off-list is fine.  Or has this been done and can I get a copy.

Second,  Have the gpg developers considered adding something like this
to gpg.  Even if as a download from their site as a gpg utilty.  If in
gpg asa command like ( gpg --menue ), or ( gpg --dialog ).

I do like it and it is a reall good feature for people like my self who
like the menue system it provides to  command line program program.

My apologies; this line should be:
%gpg --export-secret-keys test1 > $GPGDIR/gpgtemp.asc
where $GPGDIR is the absolute | relative path where you put you gpg
executable and your secret keyring. All the remaining is ok.

I am developing a Java application which signs documents. I want to have

Can anybody help me with the corrected use of the --passphrase-fd

A example would be useful.

The PGPdump Interface is a web-interface for pgpdump, the (Open)PGP packet 
visualizer by Kazu Yamamoto. It can be used to determine the exact contents 
of PGP public key blocks (or any PGP encoded data for that matter) and is 
intended for those who are inconvenienced by running command line tools.

Please update your bookmarks and, should you have linked to my site (thank

Have you had a look at the archive of this mailinglist ? The question
of how to avoid typing in the password has been asked and answered
many times before for a number of programming languages.

You find the archives at: http://lists.gnupg.org/

Subject: how to revoke a key?
Message-ID: <20020325150612.GA23783@idm-06.pf.kramski.de>

Hello,

a friend has lost his passphrase. He created a revocation ceritificate,
but do not know how to revoke it at the key servers.

I told him first he should import the revocation certifikate into his
keyring and afterwards he should export his key and send this export
to the key-server.

First he sent me his exported key. I was able to import it and saw that
it is revoked. But the transfer to the keyserver fails.

I tried to find information with google, but nowhere was an exact example.
So i am not really sure if my insctrucions where ok.

gpg was started as following:

gpg --send-keys --keyserver wwwkeys.nl.pgp.net revoked-key.asc


kind regards,
Micha Holzmann

He may have to export it to a file with --armour.  Then take the file to a
clipboard.  Run up to the keyserver on the web and manually paste it as a
new key.  That's what I ended up doing when I had to use a revoke
certificate.  Thanks to David for sharing that hint with me a few weeks
back.

Hello,

a friend has lost his passphrase. He created a revocation ceritificate,
but do not know how to revoke it at the key servers.

I told him first he should import the revocation certifikate into his
keyring and afterwards he should export his key and send this export
to the key-server.

First he sent me his exported key. I was able to import it and saw that
it is revoked. But the transfer to the keyserver fails.

I tried to find information with google, but nowhere was an exact example.
So i am not really sure if my insctrucions where ok.

gpg was started as following:

gpg --send-keys --keyserver wwwkeys.nl.pgp.net revoked-key.asc


kind regards,
Micha Holzmann

I am just curious, but why did you have to go through so much trouble to
revoke a Key? We are currently in the process of updating our PGP-Basics
Lists' GnuPG/Windows Help File, and in it we mention that once the file
that was first created in the revocation process is imported back into
your KeyRing, all that remains is to upload the Public Key to the
KeyServer. Is that not true?

What shell are you using?  That's a SH-ish shell line, but the error
message is from csh or a near relative.

Try the command using sh or bash.  If you must do it with csh, try
this:

gpg --batch --decrypt --list-only --status-fd 1 | awk '/^\[GNUPG:\] ENC_TO / { print $3 }'

The Shamir and geometric threshold schemes are fairly straightforward and
secure protocols, so the usability design isn't really an issue. Simply feed
your sharing program it N shares (as files or whatever), in any order, and
it reconstructs and displays the secret. What's really needed, I suppose,
would be a standard message format that would encapsulate the sharing
algorithm used, the degree of the (m,n) threshold scheme, and the actual
data associated with the share. I would think OpenPGP packet formats could
handle this easily, with appropriate additions to the list of algorithms.

Of course, the question is, is a secret splitting feature useful enough for
it to be added to the OpenPGP standard? I think so. Heck, every organization
should probably share it's administrative pass phrases and keys in such a
secure manner.

Or perhaps a separate, simple "Open Threshold Scheme" standard, based on the
OpenPGP packet format, would be a better idea. Some form of standard is
desirable so that shares can be recovered universally. If I make a custom
program to split disaster recovery passwords for my executives, but both
myself and my custom share combining program are inaccessible when a
disaster recovery needs to be occur, the whole exercise was pointless.

Signing isn't really the issue. My intent is to share an administrative pass
phrase such that any two executives can get together and reconstruct it, but
one executive losing or compromising his "secret card" doesn't compromise
the pass phrase.

Generally, "no valid OpenPGP data found" means just that - the key is
not found on the server.

However, the certserver.pgp.com keyserver is having problems right
now, so you shouldn't take that error message too seriously.  Try
another keyserver.

It's unclear what, if anything, will happen with the
certserver.pgp.com keyserver with the recent changes at pgp.com.
People have been asking on the keyserver operators list, but no
answers yet.

No they're not very reliable currently. perhaps that has to do with NAI=20

try another keyserver, try sending via http proxy (it helps in communication

Subject: how do i get gnupg to read the passphrase from standard in
Message-ID: <3C9FAE3E.6F9C51EF@sesame.com>

I need to have gnupgp read the passphrase as standard in.

I want to pipe a passphrase stored in a java BatchMail program into
gnupgp for encrypting files.
I want to do this directly by piping the passphrase into gpg standard
in.

I cannot pass parameters into an echo because this is visible to ps.  I
cannot store the passphrase in a file for security reasons.

Here's what I'm playing with right now:

 encrypt.sh "me@me.com" "recipient@recipient.com" "filename"

where encrypt.sh is:

#! /bin/sh
gpg -s -e -o - --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --default-user $1 --yes
--no-tty -r $2 $3  < -

But i don't want gpg to hook into the standard out of my BatchMail
program, but rather the standard out of the ScriptProcess that executed
the command.   I think I am on the right track but don't have any
difinitive answers yet.  Can someone please help?

I assume you mean key ID?  The regular or short key ID is just the
lower half of the long key ID.

For example:

Long keyID:  DB698D7199242560
Short keyID:         99242560

Incidentally, for OpenPGP keys (DH/DSS or v4 RSA) you can do the same
trick with "how do I get a key id from a fingerprint".

Fingerprint: 7D92FD313AB6F3734CC59CA1DB698D7199242560
Long keyID:                          DB698D7199242560
Short keyID:                                 99242560

Poor wrapping by the Mail Client, i.e. wrapping of text after the message
has been signed is one of the most probable causes, unless you use a
WYSIWYG Editor. Also, I see this in your headers:

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I'm not sure if I'm using the correct vernacular, but some Servers will be
cause for concern if they convert the text to 7 bit. I could not check
your signature because I could not find your Key on any of the Servers.

I don't understand this last paragraph in the light of what you wrote ear=

Upload your key to a keyserver (e.g. pgp.dtype.org), so we can check what=
's=20
going on.

No. KMail doesn't do that ;-)

If the server converts 8but labelled content to 7bit, he will only do so =
if=20
the content is 7bit text only. Since 8bit and 7bit are both incarnations =
of=20
the identiy transformation, the conversion would not invalidate the sig.

Most likely Lee is missing something obvious, like confusing invalid=20
signatures with untrusted keys. Am I right here?

I don't understand this.  GpgmeData is an object to store large
amounts of data, you probably can't squeeze it into 8 bits.

Maybe you want this.  
char gpgme_data_release_and_get_mem (GpgmeData dh, size_t *r_len)

 Release the data object DH and return its content and the length
 of that content.  The caller has to free this data.  DH maybe NULL
 in which case NULL is returned.  If there is not enough memory for
 allocating the return value, NULL is returned but the object is
 still released.

If you want's to keep the object you have to use the rewind and read
functions.

You dont really have to (it is possible to make gpg use untrusted keys) but
you should verify the keys with your friend and then sign it.

No, but GPG will tell you that the key is not guarunteed to belong to the 
purported owner and ask if you still want to use it.

I use "gpg --lsign KeyID" to sign keys that I am confident belong to the
online identity that I am familiar with. That command creates a
non-exportable signature that basically means you trust the key enough to
tell GPG not to keep asking you about it, but not enough to publicly
endorse the key.

yes. You may use GPG as you like. If you intend to modify the source, see
the GNU General Public License v2 terms.

Yes, indeed. The GNU General Public License allows you to use the
program commercially without paying any royalties. If you use parts of
the source in other programs or link any part of it into another
program, you have to share the source code of this program with the
public. That's what the GPL is about -- no money business, the source
code is the real treasure.

All,

Is it possible to use gpg to encrypt AOL Instant Messenger communications?
We're interested in using AIM in our corporate environment, but are very
concerned about the lack of encryption of these messages as they travel over
the internet to AOL & back.

Alternatively, is there another product available that would offer the buddy
list & chat features of AIM, in a secure message transport?  We're less
interested in the ftp, chat room, and other AIM features.  It's the IM
portion that is of most interest to us.

Thanks,

Cory

I picked the following up from http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html 

Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute,
study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four
kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: 

* The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). 
* The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs
(freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom
2). 
* The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the
public, so that the whole community benefits. (freedom 3). Access to the
source code is a precondition for this. 

[snip]

``Free software'' does not mean ``non-commercial''. A free program must be
available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial
distribution. Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual;
such free commercial software is very important.

Jabber with Gabber client. Jabber is an open IM (see http://jabber.com and
http://jabber.org) and some clients, partucularly Gabber (for GNOME) and
at least one windows client support PGP encryption (Gabber uses GnuPG).

The Jabber system supports your desires, and several clients support PGP
or GnuPG.

Thank you Steve for this comment. It is ridiculous how many

<freeware> and <free software>
especially the commercial part of it is not understood properly
SB> ``Free software'' does not mean ``non-commercial''.

I keep explaining it all the time to the people i meet :)

What i don't understand quite well is why OSI,GPL and alike
licenses are not compatible with free competition rule.
The rule i find to be more important than 4 freedoms you mentioned
Here is an example:
GPL'ed software is offered (for extra money) to those who are not satisfied with GPL
conditions, that means in fact that those who use the software under
GPL are discriminated compared to those who use the same software
under modified and less restrictive conditions.

>From this point of view I find LGPL to be much better.

Not quite.

If you distribute binaries built from modified source, then you must make 
the modified source available to the recipients of the modified binaries.

You don't have to make the source available to "the public" unless you
distribute binaries to "the public", and you don't have to distribute the
code at all if you don't distribute the binaries.

The binaries and code remain under the GPL, so if they are distributed, the 
recipients can modify and/or redistribute them if they wish, according to 
the GPL.

You don't epxect people to believe this trollish talk, do you?

First, there is no "free competition rule".

Second, if an author of GPL'd software sold copies to another party under
a non-GPL license, that party would likely have many more restrictions
placed upon them than the GPL does.  For instance, they likely wouldn't be
allowed to distribute any changes and would only be able to use it for the
purpose X and not Y.  The GPL grants both these freedoms.  The third party
would get a tradeoff of being able to resell/link to the product, but with
other restrictions put in place.

And you certainly don't seem to have a grasp of what the OSI is, and how
it differs from the FSF.

It's great that Steve tried to explain what <free software> is all about
now i see that my understanding of it is quite different from yours, Frank
For me <free software> means first of all freedom to compete on it,
and what i see in GPL - it does not really garantee such a freedom

But ok , this discussion should be taken elsewhere...
If you like you can enlighten me on OSI privately or redirect me
to some appropriate forum (thank you in advance)...

I think double licensing (if that's what you mean here) is a very bad
thing - but I don't think it'll play an important role in the future: if
I understand copyright law correctly, only the copyright holder can give
out licenses. For most open source projects, the copyright holder is
either somebody like GNU (who never will play such games, I guess), or
the contributing deveolpers have kept the copyright of their respective
portions (I believe this is how the Linux kernel is distributed), so
double licensing would involve getting permissions from all copyright
holders.

Just my $.02

Subject: FAQ item?: Using GnuPG in a business
Message-ID: <20020326182530.GA681@akamai.com>

With the recent changes at NAI/pgp.com, there has been a definite
upswing with the "can I legally use GnuPG in my business?" questions.

While the GPL discussions are interesting, I suspect that the majority
of the people asking this question are companies that just want to use
GnuPG now that they can't use PGP.  Most questions of code
modification or distribution don't apply to them - they just want a
PGP-alike to use.  Naturally, the GPL lets them do this.

Could someone write this up and stick it on a web page somewhere?  If
nobody jumps at it, perhaps I'll have a crack at it in a couple of
days.  The idea here is to make it very clear that if they're just
talking about using it (rather than making their own version and
distributing the changes, or whatever else), then they don't need to
bother to read beyond the first paragraph.

Maybe this should be a FAQ - I saw Douglas Calvert volunteered to be
the new FAQ maintainer.

The term "Free Software" when used to describe software licensed under the 
GPL, has a very specific meaning published by the Free Software Foundation 
<http://www.fsf.org/>.

On the first page of http://www.gnupg.org/ is a link saying 'Free Software'
that takes a person to http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.  Now, I
agree that a person has to read pretty far down that page to find

"Thus, you may have paid money to get copies of GNU software, or you may
have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your
copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to
sell copies. 

``Free software'' does not mean ``non-commercial''. A free program must be
available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial
distribution. Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual;
such free commercial software is very important."

Perhaps a disclaimer at the top or even back on www.gnupg.org where the
'Free Software' link is at, the wording could be changed from:

"It can be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public Licence" (where Gnu General Public Licence is a link)

To say:

"This software may be freely used, modified and distributed in any
commercial or non-commercial environment without payment of royalties under
the terms of the Gnu General Public License"   (where Gnu General Public
License would still be a link)

An addition to the FAQ up toward the top (it's been awhile since I read it)
might also be appropriate.  I know it took me a couple of days of digging
through the web site before I could convince myself and my boss that this
was for real.

Yes, that's exactly what worries me about the current documentation
and web pages.  The fact that it took you that long to be sure the GPL
allowed you to use GnuPG freely means that it just isn't clear enough.

The GPL gives users many wonderful things, but a good-sized piece of
the "target market" for GnuPG simply don't care about modifying the
code or redistributing it.  What is needed for those people or
businesses is a simple statement that says "Yes, it's free.  No, there
are no licencing fees.  No, there are no patent issues.  Take it and
enjoy using it.  If you want more help than is available for free on
the Internet, then these three companies will even sell you support
for it."

I'm not sure I fully understand this.  Why not just use the
--use-embedded-filename flag?

If you do not want this converted, use "Content-Conversion: prohibited".

Hey, no worries.  It's a pretty big manual - easy to miss stuff in

I got a good signature from this message when using GnuPG 1.0.6.
Fetched your key from wwwkeys.net.uk.pgp.net , works like a dream here
at least.

I got a good sig with GPG and a bad sig with PGP. Ensure that textmode
is set and that your mail client wraps lines correctly. Your message was
sent with the lines not wrapped.

I used PGP 6.58 on Linux and the sig failed. with GnuPG 1.06 on Linux the
sig verified. I've seen this before, but I don;t remember what the fix is.

I have gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.4 version.

Please help me out in solving this problem.

I've seen this under two conditions (which are twins of each other):

1.  The file was FTP'ed using ASCII rather than Binary mode from a =
Windows
box to a *NIX box.  This causes all <CR> bytes to be dropped from the =
file.

2.  The file was sent in Binary mode from a WSFTP client to a Linux =
host.
One or more (but not all) <CR> characters where dropped.  The file is at
least one byte short.  Wish I could find the culprit cause it only =
happens
with one client!

On first run of 'gpg' it creates a directory at /.gnupg on a unix system.
Is there a way in the config or at the command line to create this directory
at say /local/.gnupg?

    1024-bit encryption is 'compromised'

    Upgrade to 2048-bit, says crypto expert

    According to a security debate sparked off by cryptography expert
    Lucky Green on Bugtraq yesterday, 1,024-bit RSA encryption should
    be "considered compromised".

    The Financial Cryptography conference earlier this month, which
    largely focused on a paper published by cryptographer Dan Bernstein
    last October detailing integer factoring methodologies, revealed
    "significant practical security implications impacting the
    overwhelming majority of deployed systems utilising RSA as the
    public key algorithm".

    Based on Bernstein's proposed architecture, a panel of experts
    estimated that a 1,024-bit RSA factoring device can be built using
    only commercially available technology for a price range of several
    hundred million to $1bn.

I guess this is the same thing that was discussed last week on this
list. I'm not into this level of cryptoanalytics, but what do you folks
say about this? I guess there is no need to get upset of this, if Big
Brother wants my bytes, I suppose he has other ugly ways to compromise
the key -- bugging my flat or setting up some kind of scanners to
analyze the keyboard radiation or maybe plain old violence. I doubt the
govs wants to use millions of euro to read my mail. But I admit it's
damn irritating to read this now that I changed my key only one month
ago. *grmpf*

The question is floating around among us -- would it be wise to upgrade
to 2048 bits, or is this just speculations? Now that they're talking
about this, I guess one should be a step ahead of the snoopers --
especially when it comes to the future robustness of the signatures.

In _binary_ mode??? Sheesh, that's an ugly one! Is this a common flaw
with the WSFTP clients, or a specific version? Bugs like that cannot be
accepted, it has to be corrected ASAFP.

You decide where GnuPG shall put its home directory with the $GNUPGHOME
environment variable.

export GNUPGHOME=3D/usr/local/.gnupg

I wish I knew!  So far it is happening only with one client.  But it =

to happen every time they need to send the file.  So far they can resend =
it
up to four times before all the bytes show up.=20

I'm pointing the finger at the client's software.  So far they are =

my

attempts
to decrypt usually so that problem that started this thread (zlib =
inflate)
but have shown various other errors. =20

So, if in doubt, have the client verify the length of the file!

We have one client using RSA.  Last fall they moved to 4096 bits due to
rumors about vulnerability at 1024.  We moved to 2048 bit DSA/ELG-E at the
same time.  Perhaps we're just paranoid.

Care to tell me the RFC number where this is specified?
Since when do broken mail relays adhere to anything other than their creators' 
confused minds? ;-)

I used to get that error on 1.0.4, a lot, and never on 1.0.6. Maybe 
you can upgrade to 1.0.6 and see if it helps.

RFC1344, but is an informational RFC that makes recommendations. It is not 
a standard.

Subject: AW: 1024 bit encryption compromised?
Message-ID: <51896D38E5E4D111BE560001FA68BA369FB70E@SBO1002>

Hm. Up to now I had only read opinions that stated that Bernstein's 
result was still rather theoretical.

I guess it all depends on who you want to hide your stuff from. If you need
to keep stuff from Governments or billion Dollar corporations, you better be

paranoid. If you just want to keep stuff from your small provider's admin
I'd guess that 1024 bit RSA still goes a long way.

Personally I use GnuPG for "political" reasons rather than for a true need
for cryptography. I assume that by using and promoting GnuPG, building a
web of trust and so forth (besides the fact that it's fun ;-), I might 
weaken the position of crypto opponents, who might argue that only
criminals use crypto anyway.

If I were to create a new key now, I would make it 2048 bits. Since I
have two fairly well signed 1024 bit keys (Ranking 1722 and 2003 in the
dtype.org statistic ;-), I'll stick with those as long as there are no
further advances in cryptanalysis.

Tschuess,
Ralf

No commercial restrictions.  No royalties.  You can give the source away.

Basically the only restriction is that if you give a binary away you
must accompany it with the source (or a written statement that you
promise to deliver the source on request without any extra fee).

That's not a restriction, that's a feature. :)

I need to encrypt emails sent through an Agora Shopping Cart system I have
setup on an account I have setup HostingMatters.com

How do I go about doing that? I went to your web site (www.gnupg.org), but
don't really see anything as to where to start. All I see is how to set it
up on the server, but I don't have access to the server and let's say it was
already setup on the server, then what? Is there something I need to
download? How do I set it up in the shopping cart? How do I set it up on my
client's PC for email retrieval?

I sent this same email to HM, but they said it was beyond them and couldn't
help. Can you? (I also sent this directly to gnu@gnu.org and they told me
to send this email to this user-group).

Any advice would be much appreciated.

I found the problem. In full compliance with the OpenPGP specs GPG uses=20
v4 signatures by default. GPG has an option to force it to use v3=20
signatures. man gpg says:
       --force-v3-sigs
                 OpenPGP states  that  an  implementation  should
                 generate v4 signatures but PGP 5.x recognizes v4
                 signatures only on key  material.   This  option
                 forces v3 signatures for signatures on data.

Obviously PGP 6.5.8 also can't handle v4 signatures.

Solution:
Add 'force-v3-sigs' to your ~/.gnupg/options file.

Ingo

I have a problem importing a secret key from another
computer. I've made a "gpg --export-secret-key --armor
teiva", scp the key to the other computer, but there, all I
have is a :
teiva@zephyr:~/.gnupg$ gpg --import
--allow-secret-key-import teiva_pvkey.asc
gpg: key B7E9F209: no user ID
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg: secret keys read: 1

What did I made wrong ?

Thanks for your help

Judging from the error message it seems as GPG also wants the public
key. The secret key contains no personal information, so GnuPG has no
user ID that refer to this secret key. Try to import the public key
first, then import the secret key the way you did.

Actually, the public key is already imported. That's why I
really don't understand why I can't import the private
key... Anyway, if that is the problem, is there any away to
force gnupg to import the key, without caring about personal
informations ?

This is not correct - the secret key should contain everything in the
public key except for key signatures (other than the self-signature).

It's possible you don't have a user ID packet in your secret key for
some reason.  Can you tell me what GnuPG displays when you add
--verbose to your command line?

There are several pieces of information that need to be mentioned in
the answer for this question.  The thing that I think is most
important, though, is that it is very clear very early in the answer
that it is just fine to use it in a business and there are no licence
fees or contracts to be signed.  A lot of the free software documents
on the net are very good and very complete but don't really get to the
heart of the question for a business that just wants to use it (as
opposed to distribute, modify, and so on).

Many business folks don't really understand free software, and we
should make their first experience with it be as painless and happy as
possible :)

Looks like that was the problem. The signature looks good on my PGP 6.5.8=
 now=20
but I haven't heard back from my friends yet to be sure that their versio=
n of=20
PGP shows the signature as good.

As you can see from my "Real Name" I have a continuous issue with the=20
German "Umlaut".

RFC 2047 now allows the use non-ASCII characters in the message Header, and =

most clients these days support it.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2047.txt?number=3D2047

When I recently downloaded GnuPG and created my Key-Pair, I created the=20
UserID real name with the "Umlaut". No problem so far on my machine (which=20
BTW is W2K).

Problem came when I submitted my key to a keyserver which failed to read=20
the non-ASCII character correctly.

I suspect that this is caused by my W32 environment using ISO-8859-1 and=20
the specification for OpenPCP speficifying UTF-8.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2440.txt

However after half a day on this problem I can't seem to find a solution to =

creating a key that represents the Umlaut correctly so that it will appear=20
properly in the message header/cmail client under RFC 2047, and in the=20
Keyserver Listing accroding to RFC 2440.

I am sure this is a very common problem in German speaking regions and=20
there is an obvious solution.

Help would be very much appreciated.

Using the command line "gpg --compress-algo 0 --export > pgpmsg.asc"
with gpg 1.0.6d yields the same results as --compress-algo [1,2]. The md5su=
ms
for each pgpmsg.asc are the same.  Shouldn't this command create uncompress=
ed
output (so that I can later compress it more efficiently with bzip2)?

Same here.

Well, obviously this is the keyserver's fault. My user id is also not=20
displayed correctly on the WWW interface of the keyserver and PGP 6.5.8=20
also doesn't do it right (I heard that PGP 7 finally does it correctly,=20
but who cares anyway). GnuPG OTOH is RFC 2440 compliant and encodes the=20
user id correctly in utf-8.

Why should the user id appear in a message header?

The obvious solution I can propose is not to use a broken mail client=20
which can't handle utf-8 encoded user ids correctly.

But maybe there is really a problem with your user id. Please send your=20
public key to the list so that we can have a look.

Sorry, but the output of --export was never compressed
in the first place.  It does a binary export of all public keys
in your keyring.  (compress-algo and -z have no effect in
this situation.)   You can do --armor --export  if you
want the output to be a non-binary ascii file (which you
can then compress), but --export already produces an
uncompressed binary file.  You would do:

   gpg  --export >mykeys.gpg
   gpg  -a --export >mykeys.asc
   gpg  -a -o mykeys.asc --export

Yes, it didn't work.
It would be rather useful if when exporting the compression options took
effect.

I didn't mean that it should. Actually I have no problem at all on the mail =

client side. It works fine. Displays the "real name" in the header ok, and=20
uses the key just fine too. I am using Mulberry V2.2b4 BTW.

My only problem is that the Keyserver is not displaying the name correctly=20

Message-ID: <20020331015328.A5513@localhost>

Hi gnupg-users,

gpg --list-key shows pubkeys in pubring.gpg twice, 
whereas pubkeys from "included" pubring.pgp are single in the
listing (see below).                    ^^^

This is especially annoying, when using gpg in mutt: every time i
mail (and encrypt) to a person from which i have only one key
mutt asks me which one from the listing of two identical keys i
want to use for encrytion.

I am using gpg 1.06 as packed in debian sid. I reimported the
whole pubring.gpg but that did not help. Any ideas?


This is a listing which shows keys from gpg-pubring.gpg mixed
with keys from pgp-pubring.pgp:

The default for --export is already uncompressed.  If you want to
compress keys, use --compress-keys along with the usual
--compress-algo.

Note that GnuPG can import compressed keys just fine, but if you
compress outside of GnuPG (with gzip or bzip2 or whatever), then
you'll need to uncompress it yourself before --importing it back into
GnuPG.

Your public keyring is being checked twice.  Edit ~/.gnupg/options, and
remove the "keyring" entry for ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.  Current versions
of gpg use the default keyring file automagically, while older ones
required that it be specified explicitely... that's been my experience
on Debian, anyway.

Subject: Install GnuPG on Win98?  Use GPA?
Message-ID: <VA.00000013.005e94d5@gwstrong.com>

I've downloaded GnuPG 1.0.6 and GPA.  I'm assuming GPA is the standard 
Win32 GUI to use with GnuPG after reading a few messages.  The files 
are gnupg-w32-1.0.6-2.zip and gpa-0.4.3.tar.gz, respectively.  

It looks like most of the documentation on the web site pertains to the 
"standard" installation onto Linux and running GnuPG from the prompt.  
The site does state GnuPG can be used on Win32 OS's.  I would rather 
use GnuPG with a more user friendly frontend, but have experience 
working from the prompt on DOS before Windows took over.  

I would like to use GnuPG with my email client either encrypting email 
or using with signatures for authentication.  Presently I'm using 
Virtual Access 5.51 for an email client, but this may change to Agent 
in the future.

My questions are as follows:
1) Any special installation instructions for Win98?

2) If GPA is the standard GUI, can I use this with any email program?  

3) If #2 is yes, is there any threads in the archives which would 
provide some help.  

I'm never used PGP.  I've read the Howtos and parts of the manual, so I 
have some background.  Actually using the application would be the best 
experience, and would like to get a good start.  TIA!

GPA is probably the best GUI for it, of which I use, along with WinPT
(http://www.winpt.org) due to its tasktray availability and clipboard
features.

Working with GnuPG via command line is fairly simple, provided you
read over the man file and some documentation, however the GUI
automation is great, but, with GnuPP, of which is explained a bit
below, you can use the GUI utilities or still choose to run it at the
command line. Your call.

I would recommend downloading the GnuPP package, which bundles GnuPG,
GPA, and WinPT together for easy installation.
The GnuPP site it in German, but with a little help from Google
translation, you should be able to comprehend everything at:

http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.gnupp.de/&pre
v=/search%3Fq%3DGnuPP%26hl%3Den


As for integration with mail clients, on my Windows 98 box, I use
GPGOE (for Outlook Express), which utilizes the S/MIME encrypt/sign
buttons (although not using S/MIME) to do the GnuPG encrypt/sign
routines. I am well pleased with it, especially after migrating from
all the GUI eye-candy of PGP and its mail plugins.

Also, check http://www.gnupg.org/frontends.html for plugins and such
which might be of use to you and whichever mail client you decide on
using.

Hope this helps you get started with using the application. If you
have any questions, feel free to send 'em on.

If you force your browser to UTF-8, it should display the umlaut correctl=

But your key's id isn't properly encoded, sorry.

Like any other options, you can strip the two leading dashes to obtain a =

that you can put in your .gnupg/options file.

Thanks for confirming that I do in fact have a problem.

Yes this works for me. Now I get Ingo Umlaut properly and mine as a box. So =

I can clearly see the problem.

> Because Ingo's umlaut is valid UTF-8 and your's is not ;-(

No, I didn't. At this stage I have to confess that I use that "temporary=20
workaround until you get a GNU OS" called MS-W2K ;-)

So I used the W2K version of gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6-2 to create my key.=20
Obviously this is via command line and I think this is where the problem=20
stems from.

How do I enter the O-Umlaut in a W2K command prompt window which is running =

gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6-2? Currently I am holding down the Alt-key and typing=20
0246 on the numeric keypad. This is obviously not working, ie not giving=20
gpg the correct character. Is there an escape sequence I should using. If=20
so what?

Thanks

Oliver

I originally tried no-comment in the options file but it
doesn't actually work, that's why I was asking about it.

After some trial and error I came up with the solution:

comment ""

... single quotes don't work - go figure.

FYI (from the manpage):

--no-comment
        Do  not  write  comment  packets.   This  option
        affects   only   the   generation   of    secret
        keys.  Please  note, that this has nothing to do
        with the comments in clear text signatures.

STOP: If you use GPA-0.5 (aka GnuPP, AFAIK), make sure to generate your=20
keypair (if any) _on the command line_. GPA-0.5 has a nasty bug that will=
=20
result in all non-us-ascii characters encoded invalidly. Don't know if th=
is=20
slipped into the GnuPP release, but I guess so.

Not that it would matter for Greg, but one should be careful when recomme=
nding=20
GPA-0.5.

Right, my apologies. I used WinPT for key generation, however, so
I've had no problems. GPA 0.5.0 is packaged with GnuPP, so it would
be best to either
use WinPT or generate from the command line.

Thanks for pointing that out, Marc.

I realized the problems with German special characters short before
the GnuPP package was released so I decided to add UTF8 support for
key generation and key listing into WinPT.

I guess it's on the TODO list of the GPA to do the same, but I'm
not sure when this will happen.

With reference to my earlier mails, Subject "Creating user id's with=20
International Characters"

I have now also downloaded and installed the GnuPP package. Using WinPT to=20
generate a new key I get exactly the same problem. The Umlaut is not=20
encoded properly into the key.

I now suspect that is has to do with the Windows locale setting. My machine =

is bought in the UK and I run it with System Locale=3DUK, english keyboard=20
etc... Could this be affecting how GnuPG and/or WinPT read the command=20
line/input box on which I type in the real name. In other words, could it=20
be that not having a German locale and using Alt-0246 to type in the &ouml=20
character is confusing the applications?

This is getting frustrating, please help.

Oliver

again the new key I have generated, this time using WinPT from the GnuPP:

Hmmm, this is strange. I generated some test keys with international
characters in the userID and they were correctly encoded into ISO-8859-1.
So the "gpg -k" output was okay.

I'm not sure about this but maybe it caused the problem.

YES!!!

You are right. The second key does not have the problem. I didn't notice=20
because WinPT hadn't updated its keycache and I wasn't familiar with the=20
app yet.

BUT...The good key was created with WinPT!!

so you are also right about it correctly handling the umlaut..


The command line doesn't work no matter what I do. I am sure it is some=20
hidden **%$=A3 option in windows (because I have a UK machine) that is =
making=20
the command line box use the wrong character set. If I set the Locale=20
Location under Control Panel/Regional Options/general to Germany and then=20
create a new uid with gpg command line, the following happens:

Command> adduid
Real name: Oliver Sch=F6nrock
Email address: oliver@schonrocks.com
Comment:
You are using the `iso-8859-1' character set.
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Oliver Sch=F6nrock <oliver@schonrocks.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?

I only got the ISO-8859-1 message once while in English Locale, when I very =

first did this 2 days ago. Now the message is back becaus of the German=20
Locale. It still produces the wrong character for the Umlaut!!

anyway my personal problem is solved, since I can generate a key with=20
WinPT!!! but surely there is some really fishy stuff going on with that=20
command line box and Locale setting (or whatever else Windows is hiding).

Hope this will help someone in the future. My lesson although I don't fully =

understand what happened there is:

"if you have a windows system locale other than the language you are trying =

to use, don't use command line gpg to make your uid. Use WinPT instead!".

Maybe using the option "--charset iso-8859-1" helps. This will force gpg=20
too assume that you use latin1. Now try again to enter the =F6 as above=20
(246 is the correct code for the =F6 in latin1).

Alternatively try the option "--charset utf-8" and enter Alt+0195=20
Alt+0182 (this is the utf-8 code for =F6).

I have never tried GPA but from reports I've read you are better advised
to run one of the two other Win32 GUI's available:

GPGShell v2.27
http://www.jumaros.de/rsoft/gpgshell.html

WinPT
http://www.winpt.org/

Of the two GUI's mentioned, my favourite is GPGShell but that is just a
personal observation. Try them both and compare the two side by side.

I've already downloaded WinPT.  I'm should have it installed and working 
hopefully before the end of the day.  From what I've read, I like the fact 
it is not email client dependent.

None of the Win32 GUI's for GnuPG are Client dependant... that is the
beauty of using them. ;o)

If the package you are referring to is at http://www.winpt.org/download.html, 
then I don't believe GPA is bundled.  From reading the documentation only 
WinPT & GnuPG.  The site now has documentation in English, so no translation 
required.

Since I have NOT used GnuPG, the integration into email is a little vague to 
me at this time.  I will have to install and use.  I would imagine the 
frontend plugins basically make the integration into the email client 
seamless.

One of the reasons I want to try WinPT is the fact that it is not email client 
dependent.  I haven't yet decided what email program I will using long term, 
so this is a big plus.  From the GnuPG reading I've done so far, you can use 
it to encrypt a message or sign a message.  As I understand it the signing of 
the message authenticates the message being sent by you.  Since most of the 
people I communicate online with do not use PGP, this would be my primary 
purpose.  However, if needed the encryption option is always a big plus.

After receiving the WinPT recommendation from you and other sources, I have 
decided to give it a try.  Thanks for the information.

Subject: Restrictions / Commercial Use?
Message-ID: <VA.00000019.00c98b24@gwstrong.com>

Are there any restrictions on using GnuPG for commercial use?  

GnuPG says at http://www.gnupg.org/ that "GnuPG is a complete and free 
replacement for PGP. Because it does not use the patented IDEA 
algorithm, it can be used without any restrictions."  

While the installation instructions for GPGshell at 
http://www.jfrisch.de/GPG-Install/Seiten-englisch/index.html states 
that If you want to use GPG in a non-commercial environment I recommend 
to use the following GPG-version. Please keep in mind that this file 
contains a version with implemented IDEA-algorithm which is free only 
for non-commercial use!"

On http://www.jumaros.de/rsoft/gpgshell.html the author states that 
"GPGshell is a graphical interface for GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard). GnuPG 
is a free RFC2440 (OpenPGP) compliant replacement for PGP. Because it 
does not use the patented IDEA algorithm, it can be used without any 
restrictions."

I've scanned the GNU General Public License (GPL) in plain text format 
at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt.  I believe this license governs 
the distribution of GnuPG.  I don't recall seeing any restrictions on 
use meaning commercial versus non-commercial.

The only thing I can see different is the fact that GPGshell 
installation instructions reference a different file, 
gnupg-w32-1.0.6.zip, than GnuPG, gnupg-w32-1.0.6-2.zip.

I have not installed GnuPG or any frontend.  These statements seem to 
conflict each other, or am I missing something here.  Please explain.  
TIA!

This is correct.  Use it commercially, use it non-commercially, use it
for whatever you like.  Have fun.

However, if you want to use the IDEA cipher then the situation changes
a little.  The IDEA cipher is patented by a Swiss company called Ascom
Systec Ltd.  They require a licence for commercial use.

GnuPG does not come with IDEA, despite what people may have added to
their own copies of the distribution.  You don't even need IDEA unless
you are trying to communicate with a user who uses certain versions of
PGP 2.  Since the current version of PGP is 7, it's been a few years
since PGP 2...

Short answer: No.

But... Some binary GnuPG packages for Windows include the non-free IDEA=20
plugin. These packages must not be used in a commercial environment.

So, if you want to use GnuPG for commercial use you must install a=20
binary GnuPG package which does not include the IDEA plugin.

Hope this helps.

Regards,
Ingo

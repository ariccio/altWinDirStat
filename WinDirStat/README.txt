=============================================================================
WinDirStat is a disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool for MS Windows
(all current variants). It shows disk, file and directory sizes in a treelist
as well as graphically in a treemap, much like KDirStat and Sequoiaview.


=============================================================================
If you make any changes or enhancements, find bugs or have feature requests,
please contact us. Note, however, that not all proposed features will be
taken into account as we want to keep WinDirStat what it is: a tool to view
disk usage statistics and to clean up your disk, simple and intuitive.


=============================================================================
WinDirStat is an application written in Visual C++ using MFC 7.0.
It runs on MS Windows (9x, NT, 2000, XP).

It shows where all your disk space is gone and helps you clean it up.

Design and many details are based on KDirStat (kdirstat.sourceforge.net).
WinDirStat is "a KDirStat re-programmed for MS Windows".

The directory tree is simultanously shown as a treelist and as a treemap.
One can effortlessly gain an impression of the proportions on the hard disk(s).

Major features:
* 3 views, Directory tree, Treemap and Extension list, coupled with each other,
* Built-in cleanup actions including Open, Delete, Show Properties,
* User defined cleanup actions (command line based),
* Language is English by default; further translations can be added as
  resource DLLs,
* Online-Help,
* A little setup.exe which installs the files and shortcuts.


=============================================================================
This is a Microsoft Visual Studio.NET 2003 - Project.

Trying to backport this project was already done and failed. However, should
you succeed in doing so, please send us your changes.

I've commented
- every source file
- every class
- every data member.

I haven't commented most member functions, maybe because my working English 
is not so good (I mostly would have duplicated the function name).

How to create a resource dll.

* Determine the language id xx und sub-language id yy as defined in winnt.h.

* Create a new project wdsrxxyy.dll: Visual C++ Project
  - Win 32 Project - Dll - empty project.

* Copy windirstat.rc, resource.h and res/*.* into the
  wdsrxxyy-Folder respective the res-subfolder.

* In the linker options - advanced set Resource Only DLL to Yes.

* In Text Include 3 adjust the LANGUAGE

* Remove the manifest and license.txt

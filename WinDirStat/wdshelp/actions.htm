		<h2>Cleanups</h2>
		<p>Serveral clean up actions can be applied to a selected item. The cleanups are 
			accessible through the main menu, the tool bar and through keyboard shortcuts.
		</p>
		<h3>Refresh Selected</h3>
		<p>Possibly an item has been deleted or modified outside of WinDirStat. "Refresh" 
			makes WinDirStat re-read the item, so that the display accords with the actual 
			conditions on the hard disk again.
		</p>
		<h3>Copy Path</h3>
		<p>Copies the path of the selected item into the clipboard.</p>
		<h3>Open</h3>
		<p>Opens the selected file. Note that in case of an executable file (.exe), this 
			means that the program is started.
		</p>
		<h3>Explorer here</h3>
		<p>Launches the Windows Explorer so that it shows the selected item.</p>
		<h3>Command Prompt here</h3>
		<p>Launches the DOS prompt in the selected directory.</p>
		<h3>Delete (to Recycle Bin)</h3>
		<p>Moves the selected item into the recycle bin. Then the item and the recycle bin 
			directories are refreshed.</p>
		<h3>Delete (no way to undelete)</h3>
		<p>Deletes the selected item irreversibly. Then the item is refreshed. Please 
			delete only files and directories, when you know that neither you nor the 
			system needs it any more!
		</p>
		<h3>Properties</h3>
		<p>Opens the 'Properties' dialog for the selected file.</p>
		<h3>Send Mail to Owner</h3>
		<p>Generates a textual report about the selected directory, which can be sent a via 
			e-mail to its owner. This is intended for network drives, which are used by 
			several people. The report accurately contains the lines displayed in the 
			directory list underneath the selected item, in the same "expansion state" and 
			in the same sort order.
		</p>
		<h3>User Defined Cleanups</h3>
		<p>In addition to these built-in clean ups you can freely <a href="userdefinedcleanups.htm">
				define your own cleanups</a>.

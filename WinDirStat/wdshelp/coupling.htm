		<h2>Coupling of the Views</h2>
		<p>The really strong point of WinDirStat is, that the three views, Directory List, 
			Extension List and Treemap, are coupled with each other.
		</p>
		<h3>Directory List -&gt; Treemap</h3>
		<p>When you <i>select</i> an item (directory or file) in the directory list, the 
			treemap also shows this item by highlighting it with a colored frame. In 
			particular you can see the size of directories.
		</p>
		<h3>Treemap -&gt; Directory List</h3>
		<p>When you click into the treemap, the mouse always hits a file (a colored 
			rectangle). After that the directory list expands (if necessary) the 
			appropriate nodes and selects this file. So you can, e.g. by clicking on a big 
			rectangle, see path and attributes of the corresponding big file in the 
			directory list.
		</p>
		<p>So, because of this mutual coupling, the selections in the directory list and in 
			the treemap are always the same.
		</p>
		<h3>Directory List + Treemap -&gt; Extension List</h3>
		<p>When you select a <i>file</i> in the directory list (or in the treemap), the 
			extension list shows the file type (the extension). The extension is selected 
			and scrolled into view. So you can see the description and the statistics for 
			this file type.
		</p>
		<h3>Extension List -&gt; Treemap</h3>
		<p>When you select a file type in the extension list, the treemap highlights all 
			files of this type.</p>

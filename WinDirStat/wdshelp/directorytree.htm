		<h2>Directory List</h2>
		<p>The directory list resembles the tree view of the Windows Explorer, with the 
			difference that it shows directories and files sorted by size descending. At 
			the top you see the directories and files, which use up most space. When you 
			expand a directory, its subdirectories are shown again sorted by size, and so 
			on.
		</p>
		<h3>Columns</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<u>Name</u>. This column shows the names of the files and directories and their 
					tree structure.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Size</u>. For files, this is the size of the file, in bytes. For 
					directories, this is the size of the subtree, that is the sum of the sizes of 
					all subdirectories and files.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Subtree Percentage</u>. This column shows, how the size of a subtree is 
					composed of the sizes of the sub-items. This information is comparable only 
					within <i>one</i> level and is always related to the expanded parent item.<br>
					[During the scanning, this column shows either a pacman or the number of read 
					jobs to do for the subtree.]
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>Percentage</u>. The same information as in "Subtree Percentage", in percent.<br>
					[During the scanning, this column can optionally show the time spent for the 
					subtree so far.]
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>Files</u>. Number of files in the subtree.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Subdirs</u>. Number of sub-directories in the subtree.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Items</u>. Number of items in the subtree. Sum of "Files" and "Subdirs".</li>
				<li>
					<u>Last Change</u>. Date of the last modification in the subtree.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Attributes</u>. File/folder attributes. R = read-only, H = hidden, S = system,
					A = archive, C = compressed, E = encrypted.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Operation</h3>
		<p>In the column "Name" you can expand and collapse the directories by a mouse 
			click on the little boxes with + and -, as in the Windows Explorer. A click on 
			a name <i>selects</i> an item. After that you can navigate in the tree with the 
			arrow keys.
		</p>
		<p>The treemap always highlights the selected item with a frame.
		</p>
		<p>If you select a file, the extension list automatically shows its type.
		</p>
		<p>The <a href="sorting.htm">sorting</a> can be set with a mouse click on a column 
			header.
